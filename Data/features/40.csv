"During the last century, light detection methods have improved signiﬁcantly, fromthermal detectors to photon detectors, focal plane arrays, and single-photon avalanchedetectors [1]. Nowadays you can reach any piece of information in a matter of milliseconds,or even less, due to the technological developments that have happened in the past severaldecades. The world is now full of different technologies that have made our lives mucheasier. It is so easy to communicate using many different means from landlines to opticalﬁbers and satellite communications. The more communication methods develop, the moresecure and fast transmission technology is needed. This fact forces the scientiﬁc communityto develop light-transmitting systems and these needs support a big interest in the lightdetection area.Currently, nanostructures with quantum wells (QW) and quantum dots (QD) are verywidely used to create photodetectors in the visible and infrared ranges. At the same time,for various applications, various semiconductor material systems are used that most fullysatisfy the speciﬁc requirements for device structures: III–V (GaAs, AlGaAs, etc.), II–VI(CdHgTe), IV–IV (GeSi, GeSn, GeSiSn), and others. However, all their potentialities arenot implemented so far and they remain one of the most promising structures for creatingoptoelectronic devices.A characteristic feature of all types of low-dimensional structures is the manifestationof the effects of spatial (dimensional) quantization, caused by the limitation of the freemovement of charge carriers in one or several directions. Size quantization effects lead toa signiﬁcant change in the energy spectrum of electrons and holes and the appearance ofdiscrete energy levels and intermediate-allowed energy bands entirely located in the bandgap of the semiconductor. This, in turn, leads to the appearance of new unique propertiesof such structures, which make it possible to create completely new types of optoelectronicdevices on their basis [2].For the ﬁrst time, the existence of spatial quantization effects in low-dimensionalsemiconductor structures (nanostructures) was experimentally demonstrated by Dingleet al. in the ﬁrst half of the 1970s when studying optical properties of AlGaAs-GaAsheterostructures with GaAs quantum well [3].

"one of the central themes of research in the early 1990s, when they were ﬁrst obtained inthe experiments by Eaglesham, Mo et al. [4,5]. Almost immediately, quantum-well effectswere observed experimentally in this system [6].The main requirements for choosing photodetectors are good performance, operationat the highest possible temperatures, and low manufacturing costs. In addition, todayit seems necessary to create on a single chip the entire set of components of ﬁber-opticcommunication lines, including light-emitting devices and photodetectors. To reduce thecosts of such systems, it is necessary that a larger number of components be made on thebasis of typical silicon technology methods.Silicon itself is transparent to radiation with a wavelength greater than 1.1 microns.Good photosensitivity in the region of λ ≈1.5 µm is possessed by germanium photodetec-tors. The Ge/Si system may be also supplemented by tin, which extends the responsivityup to 2 µm. In this regard, prospects are outlined for the creation of high-speed photodetec-tors based on Si–Ge–Sn heterostructures with high sensitivity at room temperature in thespectral range of quartz ﬁber transparency of 1.3 and 1.55 µm.Besides that, the adding of tin provides an opportunity to control the lattice constantand energy gap independently. Among the other advantages of group-IV materials isthe possibility to create multispectral detectors, rather high mobility of carriers, and fast-speed operation, along with low noise, simple design, and highly-developed technologyof synthesis.The integration of silicon, germanium, and tin heterostructures with a silicon chipand their compatibility with silicon electronic and photonic circuits has great potential forthe development of low-cost telecommunication optoelectronic modules for ﬁber opticcommunication lines operating in the telecommunication wavelength range [7–13].One of the main methods for obtaining low-dimensional structures today is molecularbeam epitaxy, the main advantages of which include low temperatures and growth rates,the possibility of abrupt interruption and resumption of growth, and precise control of thecomposition of the main substance and impurity concentrations. In this case, the analysisof the grown structures and the control of the necessary parameters can be carried outdirectly in the synthesis process.Molecular beam epitaxy and other modern technological and material advances insemiconductors have brought the possibility of fabricating heterostructures utilizing quan-tum mechanical features. For example, creating quantum wells and self-assembled quantumdots allowed researchers to manufacture better photodetectors with higher performance.In this review, we considered the latest and most modern photodetectors in the currentscientiﬁc literature, stating the types and materials while highlighting the features of eachwork with special attention to Ge-Si photodetectors. These heterostructures with quantumwells and dots have a number of unique properties that made it striking to scientists’attention and device applications.

"A quantum well is a very thin layer of one material with narrow bandgap is situatedbetween two materials with wider bandgaps. As a result a potential step is formed. Thispotential well limits the motion of carriers in one direction while they are free to move intwo other directions. When the width of the potential well is small enough, the energyspectrum of carriers becomes discrete and their motion in the thin layer becomes quantized.In this review we will consider one of the simplest quantum well devices—quantumwell photodetector.The quantum well photodetector operation relies on the intersubband absorptionwithin either the conduction band (for electrons) or the valence band (for holes).

"of quantum mechanics. The quantum well is equivalent to the classical problem of motionof a particle in a box. To obtain the energy spectrum of such particle the time independentSchrödinger equation should be solved.The SiGe/Si material system almost immediately proved to be perspective for variousapplications of nanostructures in electronics and optoelectronics. Then, SiGeSn materialsystem in various combinations of constituent elements became very promising, sincewithin their framework it is possible to control the band gap and obtain direct-gap semicon-ductors. These materials can be used to create photodetectors, solar cells, and light-emittingdevices, successfully competing with materials traditionally for optoelectronics based onIII–V and II–VI compounds [14–23].GeSn techniques have drawn a lot of attention of Si-based technology in the last coupledecades because the operating wavelengths range of this system spreads into the nearinfrared and short-wave infrared regions. Generally, scientiﬁc research on GeSn detectorshas involved an increase in the past decade leading to the development of high-performanceGeSn detectors. Today, there are several photodetectors based on Si-Ge. One of them isGe-Si-Sn alloy, which is widely used in quantum well infrared photodetectors.For example, in the work [24] a photoconductor detector made of one layer of GeSnon Ge, and working in the range between 1.5–2 µm, was shown (Figure 1).",9.96,False,3,165.97500610351562,97.71033477783203,False,False,False,body

"The photoconductor GeSn samples used in this photodetector were grown using areduced-pressure chemical vapor deposition technology. A study has been conducted onthis photoconductor using 0.9, 3.2, and 7% Sn. Electrical and optical characteristics under300 to 77 K were measured and the results of the detectivity, dark current, and responsivitywere observed and measured under equivalent conditions. It was noted that the higherthe temperature the less the performance of this photodetector is, which is caused by thedecrease in the number of thermally activated carriers. This leads to a higher noise currents,while the responsivity of the photoconductor shows the linear increase with applied voltagethat is indicative of the photoconductive gain [24].Another study has been made on GeSn alloy where a photodiode with one layer of Gequantum well was investigated [25]. The structure was grown on Si by molecular beamepitaxy. Figure 2 shows a schematic cross-section of the p-i-n photodetector structure. Thephotodetector was fabricated with quasiplanar technology.The 1550 nm photodiode was investigated and the electrical and optical characteristicswere measured under certain conditions. The dark current density of the photodiodeincreased by more than one order of magnitude, which was due to the high Sn concentrationin this sample. The optical responsivity of the photodetector was also studied, which hadshown the excellent quality of the fabricated GeSn layers.A different study had been done based on one layer GeSn on Si [26].

"There were two samples with 7% and 10% tin. Electrical and optical characteristicswere investigated for both samples. The reverse current density increased with the temper-ature as a result larger number of thermally activated carriers. The 10% Sn device showedhigher current densities compared to that of the 7% Sn device at equal conditions due to thenarrower bandgap, which also resulted in the larger number of thermally excited carriers.Other parameters were also studied such as detectivity for both samples. They have shownvery close values under the same conditions [26]. This study has shown good performanceand detectivity compared with the detectors dominating the market.The next study with one layer structure used Ge on the Si system [27]. This paperconsidered a photodiode working at 1550 nm and consisting of a 300 nm thick Ge layer,which was fabricated using molecular beam epitaxy and standard etching and lithographytechniques. The Ge p-i-n diode was grown on the Si substrate and covered by doped siliconcapping layer. After the fabrication of p-i-n photodiode, the back side of the substrate wascovered by black silicon. Optical power was induced from the rear side. The diameter ofthe mesa-structure was 400 µm, which is shown in Figure 4.It was noted that the black silicon nanostructure did not spoil the I-V characteristicsand acted similar to waveguide structures. This article established that the applicationof black silicon light-trapping structures is a possible technology to increase the respon-sivity of Ge-on-Si photodiodes. Besides that, rather good combination of bandwidth andresponsivity was achieved, making these structures viable for ultra-fast applications forcommunication [27].To enhance the absorption efﬁciency of the detector multiple layers with quantumwells may be used. One example with a GeSn/Ge multiple quantum wells (MQW) detectorwas shown in the recent work by Zhou et al. [28].

Thedark current was investigated with and without a photon-trapping structure at roomtemperature. A low dark current density of 31.5 mA/cm2 was achieved which is higher ifcompared with other photodetectors, and is also considered to be among the lowest forgroup-IV photodetectors. The dark current density increased to 45.2 mA/cm2 at −1 V whenthe photon-trapping microstructure was incorporated. It was investigated and revealedthat the increased dark current density mainly results from the increased surface leakagecurrent introduced by the photon-trapping microstructure [28].To sum up, these works enable group-IV photodetectors to be very perspective forvarious infrared systems.

"A quantum dot is a nanometer-sized semiconductor particle. The concept of “artiﬁcialatoms”, or quantum dots, has emerged since the implement of molecular beam epitaxy andthe ﬁrst work on the reduced dimensionality of semiconductors. Quantum dots are widelyused for their fully discrete energy spectrum and unique optical properties due to quantumsize effects. They absorb and emit light of speciﬁc wavelengths if their energy spectraare matched. These wavelengths can be accurately controlled by changing size, shape ormaterial composition of the particle. Hence, quantum dots are exploited in active layers formany widely-spread devices, for example, quantum dot displays and photon detectors.Thus, an alternative to photodetectors based on quantum wells can be photodetec-tors with quantum dots. Such heterostructures are promising for photovoltaic applica-tions and as receiving modules in ﬁber optic communication lines. Quantum dots havebeen successfully integrated in existing types of photodetectors, signiﬁcantly enhancingtheir performance.To realize all the potential advantages of photodetectors with quantum dots for thenear-infrared range (increased sensitivity to normally incident radiation, high photoelectricmultiplication factor, low thermal generation rate, narrow sensitivity range), the photosen-sitive region of the detector must contain an array of quantum dots with high density (onthe order of 1011–1012 cm−2) [7,29–31].The principles of operation of a photodetector with quantum dots are similar to thosewith quantum wells. The only difference is that in a quantum dot, the carrier is limitedin its movement in all three directions, hence, zero-dimensional systems of carriers arerealized [32]. It is expected that due to this limitation, quantum dot photodetectors canprovide a better performance, namely higher operating temperatures (due to longer carrierlifetimes), low dark current, and high photoelectric gain [33], which ultimately translatesinto high sensitivity and detectability [34]. In addition, due to different selection rules forthe absorption of light in photodetectors with quantum dots, it becomes possible to absorbincident radiation polarized along the normal to the layers of quantum dots.In order to achieve this regime, self-assembled islands are embedded into layers ofsemiconductors with a larger energy gap and appropriate band discontinuities. Due totheir properties, quantum dots are of high interest to modern technologies.Silicon-based semiconductor materials with nanosized germanium inclusions havebeen actively studied since the early 1990s [4,5]. Such nanoheterostructures with self-organizing germanium quantum dots on silicon, grown by molecular beam epitaxy, exhibita number of new nanoscale effects (associated with low-dimensional quantization ef-fects), which are promising from the point of view of their application in optoelectronicdevices [35–40].Next, we will introduce some of the recent scientiﬁc studies that contained a quantumdot infrared photodetector with different silicon-related materials and a different numberof quantum dot layers.Starting with one layer of quantum dots, the following study shows an ultrathin layerphotodetector with Ge quantum dots [41]. A 13 nm active layer of Ge quantum dots in SiO2matrix was fabricated on n-Ge substrate with (100) orientation. Quantum dots diametersvaried from approximately 3 to 8 nm.

"The current-voltage characteristics of the photodetector were studied at various tem-peratures which varied from 77 K to 300 K in the dark and under illumination with the640 and 1550 nm light. Reducing the active layer thickness to an ultrathin regime produceda high dark current at ambient conditions. Rise and fall times below 10 ns and 25 ns wereachieved at −1 V in the visible and near-infrared ranges which is very promising [41].This work has demonstrated that high quantum efﬁciency and fast response speed can beachieved in Ge quantum dot based photodetectors simultaneously at low voltage. Also,this work highlighted the importance of the thickness dependence of response speed in Gequantum dot photodetectors.A new example of quantum dot photodetectors was shown in the work [42]. Here aGe quantum dot photodetector with one layer of quantum dots that has a thickness of 160nm was fabricated. Ge and SiO2 were cosputtered on the n-Ge substrate.

"Ten layers of germanium quantum dots separated by 50 nm silicon barriers served asactive layers. Each Si barrier contained a boron delta-doping layer inserted 5 nm below theGe-wetting layer. The active region was sandwiched between the 200-nm-thick intrinsic Sibuffer and the cap layers. Finally, a 200-nm-thick p+−Si top contact layer was deposited.The noise current, detectivity, and responsivity as a function of voltage and temperaturewere considered and the study has shown that such a device exhibited low dark currentand operated until 200 K [43].One more study with a multilayer quantum dot photodetector was introduced nextwhere the multiple germanium quantum dot layers were grown on Si0.82Ge0.18 virtualsubstrate [44]. Ten layers of germanium quantum dots were separated by 35-nm Si0.82Ge0.18barriers (Figure 9).In this study another photodetector sample was fabricated based on pure siliconinstead of SiGe for performance comparison purpose. Both samples have shown a respon-sivity in the whole mid-wave infrared range. Also, there was a signiﬁcant improvement inthe Ge/SiGe detector sensitivity over the wavelength region from 3 to 5 µm, as comparedto the Ge/Si heterostructure. This is associated with the smaller hole effective mass in SiGelayers, which enables more efﬁcient light absorption and photoexcited hole transportation.The photoconductive gain was studied and the noise characteristics were measured, and theSiGe detector has shown a larger gain, probably due to the increase of the hole mobility, and,therefore, the decrease of the hole transit time through the device. Moreover, in this work, ametallic plasmonic structure was added to the detector to achieve better performance of thequantum dot photodetector. The measured responsivity of the SiGe-based photodetectorwith and without the plasmonic structure have shown that plasmonic structures enhancephotocurrent at the plasmon resonance frequencies compared with bare detectors [44].The development of these works led to the emergence of the idea of using plas-monic effects and microresonators in order to enhance the properties of silicon-germaniumphotosensitive structures [45]. These attempts have shown a signiﬁcant increase in thephotodetector parameters, such as resonant responsivity, when using such plasmonicstructures [46].",9.75,False,8,165.97500610351562,419.3531494140625,False,False,False,body

"Further development of the works on the fabrication of GeSn/Ge multiple-quantum-well p-i-n photodiodes has resulted in the simultaneous realization of low dark currentand high detectivity in the structures similar to those shown in Figure 5. An ultralow darkcurrent density of 16.3 mA/cm2 was achieved in the work [48] due to the low threadingdislocation density in the pseudomorphic GeSn layer [49], along with the high responsivityof 0.307 A/W and speciﬁc detectivity of 1.37 × 1010 cm·Hz1/2·W−1 at 1550 nm. Even highervalues of performance characteristics are theoretically predicted for the GeSn multiple quan-tum well photodetector with alternating layers of GeSn with different compositions [50].The recently proposed approach suggests the use of a GeSn-on-insulator platform for thecreation of metal-semiconductor-metal photodetectors with a sensitivity in the spectralrange of up to 2.2 µm [51].The works on using of GeSiSn solid solution layers have also conﬁrmed that thismaterial family is very promising for the fabrication of photodetectors in terms of extendingtheir range of operating wavelengths and enhancing sensitivity [52–56].The main problems of the application of nanostructures in photodetectors are con-nected with the low quality of the obtained structures. The improvement of technologies ofsynthesis should signiﬁcantly increase the performance of quantum well and quantum dotphotodetectors. The necessity to decrease the threading dislocation density, the numberof different phase boundaries on the surface, and micro-cracks (caused by lattice mis-match) to suppress dark currents was stated repeatedly in the literature. On the other hand,tensile-strained layers may be used for the directed strain engineering of the energy spectra.Where quantum dots are concerned, they have lower dark currents than quantumwell structures due to their higher activation energy of thermionic emission (because ofstrong quantum conﬁnement of carriers) and reduced phonon scattering, resulting ina longer carrier lifetime. However, it is very important to achieve the highest possiblehomogeneity of the ensemble of nanoislands in terms of their shape and size to reducedark current densities. Special growth modes or prepattering of the surface for the creationof sites of preferable formation of nanoislands (selective growth) are used to improvethe homogeneity. Another method of suppressing noise currents is the use of hybriddesigns such as quantum dots in a quantum well and quantum dots in a quantum wire,which allows the researchers to achieve lower dark current densities and higher operatingtemperatures by proper control and optimization of the thickness of a well or nanowire.The performance characteristics of the photodetectors reviewed in the previous sec-tions are summarized in Table 1. It may be concluded that in terms of their performancephotodetectors based on group-IV elements approach their III–V and II–VI competitors,showing values of detectivities of an order of 1012 cm·Hz1/2·W−1 [57,58].The use of various photon-trapping structures [59,60] and the creation of artiﬁcialroughness on one side of the detector is a typical route to increase the absorption coefﬁcientand quantum efﬁciency of the device. For example, alternating materials with differentrefractive indices by heteroepitaxy results in a signiﬁcant reﬂection at the interfaces. This isused to create optical Fabry-Perot resonators that reﬂect light back to the optical absorbinglayer, thus effectively increasing the width of the physically thin absorbing layer. Thesetechniques may also include exploiting distributed Bragg reﬂectors [61], capping the photo-sensitive structure with antireﬂection coatings [62], or using waveguide structures [63–71].Works on the development of new designs of nanostructures [72,73], using graphene-like 2Dmaterials [74–78] and exploiting the resonant cavity [79–81] and plasmonic effects [82,83]are also constantly being carried out.",9.82,False,10,165.89500427246094,185.8516387939453,False,False,False,body

"One more complex way for the integration of photodetectors on a silicon chip isthe fabrication of III–V epitaxial structures [84] or colloidal quantum dots [85–88] on asilicon substrate. Elements of other groups may also be used as a dopant in silicon orgermanium [89,90]. Moreover, germanium photodiodes manufactured on Ge-on-insulatorsubstrate, already showing very high performance, also ﬁt the requirements of silicon-basedtechnology [91]. Search for exotic nongroup IV elements combined with silicon is anotherroute for the evolution of Si-compatible detectors [92].In pace with the development of silicon-based photodetectors, a huge amount of workon the creation of group IV avalanche detectors (including single-photon avalanche diodes,SPAD) is carried out [93–95]. They are vital for a wide range of employment, from medicaland LIDAR applications to quantum communication technologies [96–98]. Over the pastdecade, the academic and industrial community has achieved tremendous results in theimprovement of the performance of SPADs [99–101].Another very promising direction of further development in the ﬁeld of silicon-basedintegration of electronic and photonic devices [102] is the creation of group IV light-emittingstructures [103–105]. In recent years signiﬁcant progress was achieved in the realizationof GeSn [106–108] and diamond [109] laser-active media. The use of the GeSiSn ternarycompound to improve the light-emitting characteristics of such structures also appearsto be very promising [110]. Quantum dots are also considered important light-emittingnanostructures and have been intensively studied for several decades from the point ofview of experimental aspects of the synthesis [111–120], their optical properties [121], andapplications [122–125].

"The performance of various types of photodetectors based on silicon, germanium,and tin is rapidly improving due to the dedicated efforts of many research groups. Thebandwidth and quantum efﬁciency of such devices are comparable to those of their com-petitors in the face of devices based on III–V compounds and are sufﬁcient for a number ofapplications. Thus, at present, no serious barriers are foreseen for the widespread use ofSi-compatible group-IV-based nanostructured photodetectors.The main advantages of silicon-based electronics and photonics, including their rel-ative cheapness, highly-developed technology of synthesis, compatibility with siliconintegrated circuits and CMOS-compatibility, opportunity to create multi-spectral detectors,and many others, make the research and industrial community conﬁdent in the long andbright future of this material system.The reviewed devices may play a pivotal role in the establishment of anticipatedlow-cost and high-performance Si-based photonic-integrated circuits.
