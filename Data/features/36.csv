Photodetectors Based on Micro-nanoStructure Material,20.92,False,1,175.7480010986328,137.87579345703125,False,False,False,H1
"Photodetectors converting optical signals into electrical signals have been widely utilizedand have received more and more attention in scientiﬁc research and industrial ﬁeldsincluding optical interconnection, optical communication, and environmental monitoring.Herein, we summarize the latest development of photodetectors with different micro-nanostructures and different materials and the performance indicators of photodetectors.Several photodetectors, such as ﬂexible, ultraviolet two-dimensional (2D) microscale,and dual-band photodetectors, are listed in this minireview. Meanwhile, the currentbottleneck and future development prospects of the photodetector are discussed.",9.96,False,1,175.7480010986328,276.5837707519531,False,False,False,H1
