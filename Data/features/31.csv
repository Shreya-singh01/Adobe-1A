"The current study aimed to produce Si nanostructures ultra-high sensitivity photodetector by photo electrochemical method. The effect of changing some factors on the formation of porous silicon has been studied. The etching time has been changed using a photoelectrochemical pro­cedure with a Halogen lamp. Relying on crystalline silicon n-type wafers (100) with resistivity of 0.1–100 Ω.cm, porous silicon layers were developed. Etching solution containing 16% HF was used at different etching times of (6,9,12,15,18, and 21) min. and 20 mA/cm2 current density. The properties of the (J-V) and (Jph-V) in both darkness and photocurrent density, were used in demonstrating PS. When the crystal size is around a nanometer, XRD broadening of PS nano­structures increased as the crystallite size dropped, with the peaks becoming more widened. The peak of the PL spectrum changes a little on the high-energy side, indicating the presence of quantum confinement effect in porous silicon. While analyzing SEM data, the pores have cylin­drical shape is a consequence of increasing the morphological characteristics average diameter. When compared to bulk silicon reflectivity, the observed significantly – lower PS surface Reflectance, demonstrated the porous silicon layer’s thinness. In responsivity, two peaks appeared. The first one reaction peak was absorbed in the depletion region, at 500 nm of the Al- PS. While the second peak absorption was in the PS-c-Si depletion area at 500–600 nm and on 21 min etching time, where a maximum quantum efficiency of 83% was obtained.",7.11,False,1,197.7449951171875,277.0960693359375,False,False,False,body

"The PS first discovered by Uhlirs at Bell Laboratories by accident in the mid-1950s [1,2] and later by Turner [3]. Attempts to remove the top layers of crystalline silicon wafers in a process known as electropolishing or reverse plating resulted in the formation of porous silicon layers and deposited metal oxide on their surfaces [4–7]. The principal method for fabricating porous silicon layers has been electrochemical etching in an HF-based electrolyte [8–10]. Various quantum-size phenomena arise when the size of the Si wires size is a little less over a few nanometers, making PS even more exciting. Because of its flexibility and adjustable properties, PS has become a popular material among scientists and technologists [11,12]. Over the last two decades, it has been used in a wide variety of sectors. The nanosized holes in crystalline silicon provide a sponge-like structure with pores and a crystalline silicon nanowire structure. The pore diameter, which can range from a few nanometers to a few microns depending on the formation factors, is used to classify PS. In comparison to bulk silicon, it has special electrical, chemical, and mechanical characteristics.PS has been shown to produce efficient visible light emission at room temperature [13–19].

The drilling parameter, current density, HF concentration, Si chip type, resistance, and etching duration all influence PS attributes such porosity, refractive index, and pore diameter [22]. The PS possesses unique properties such as a higher ratio of surface/volume, a great nonporous structure, and a low index of refraction, all of which point to various possible uses such as filters, chemical sensors, and antireflection coatings in solar cells [23–26].

The porous silicon was prepared by photoelectrochemical etching, we deposited aluminum film on the back side of silicon wafers n-type with a resistance of (0.1–100) Ω cm in order to create an ohmic contact then we cut it to small pieces (1 × 1 cm2). After a piece was cut, the oxides were removed by rinsing in ethanol. An electrochemical cell composed of Teflon that etches a 1 cm2 circular area on the wafer.

"Fig. 5 shows the reflection spectra of the PS compared to the c-Si sample. The Measurement of R% of PS layers showed that we can greatly reduce surface reflectivity on crystalline Si wafers by forming a thin PS layer by anodization etching. These results show that a porous surface layer on crystalline silicon actually improves performance by acting as an ARC layer. Si bulk has a high reflectance when the roughness of the PS layers is enhanced. This could be linked to the development of many layers of pores, which is thought to enhance pore diameter. Moreover, the larger the pores’ diameter, the more effective they are as showed in Fig. 5(f). PS electrical measurements imply a current density - voltage analysis (J-V). PS etching structure at various times. J-V measurements were performed in a dark closed box at room temperature. By applying a DC voltage to forward and reverse bias (from-6–6), the J-V characteristic can be determined. The J-V measurements for PS layers prepared at etching times (6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 21) min with current density at 20 mA/cm2 and 16% HF concentration. PS layers have inhomogeneous distribution and sizes of pores, resulting in variable porosity, which is determined by the porosity attribute. Fig. 6 comparing the properties of two biases exhibit rectifying behavior, which could be linked to the creation of an isotope hetero-junction [37]. This phenomenon is explained by changes in their energy gaps, which is crucial in explaining the rise in resistivity once the PS layer is generated. The high value is owing to the difference in charge carrier depletion in PS versus c-Si due to PS’s larger band-gap, which is related to the recombination process.

"The influence of varied etching time intervals (6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 21) min on formation of Porous Silicon (PS) via PECE was investigated. The results of PS show the nanostructure (mesoporous silicon) formed, with decreasing pore diameter from 52.34 nm to 28.21 nm with increasing etching time. PS has sponge like structure and the pore diameter is reduced with increased etching time which leads to decrees PS resistivity and increase the current pass through PS layer. The Al/PS/n-Si/Al photodetector shows two response peaks one at visible region and other at IR region. Also, Al/PS/n- Si/Al photodetector of PS prepared at 21 min shows high responsivity, detectivity and quantum efficiency compared with that prepared at 6 min etching time. This is due to high roughness, low reflectivity, and high photocurrent of this nanostructure. The surface morphology of the PS layer is discovered to be dependent on fabrication conditions. As a result, time shifting can be utilized to regulate the final structure’s size and shape.",7.97,False,9,39.00634765625,95.40545654296875,False,False,False,body
