"Abstract: The presence of potentially toxic pollutants, such as pesticides and metal ions, evenat low concentrations, can significantly impact aquatic environmental health. This pollution is aglobally widespread problem and requires fast and reliable analysis, especially for in-situ identifica-tion/quantification. Atomic absorption spectrometry and plasma-based spectrometry techniqueshave been considered the most analytical tools used to monitor potentially toxic metal ions in aquaticmedia and other related matrices. The dynamics of global climate change and its correlation withpollution, especially from anthropogenic sources, have encouraged the development of other fasteranalytical tools for monitoring these pollutants. A noteworthy alternative for determining potentiallytoxic pollutants is using algae-based biosensors, resulting in a cost reduction and simplification of en-vironmental analysis, enabling a more reliable comprehension of the role of humans in climate change.These biosensors, which may not have the highest sensitivity in quantification, have demonstratedremarkable potential in the identification of potentially toxic pollutants and several field applications.Biosensors can be an excellent biotechnology solution for monitoring global environmental changes.Thus, this review highlights the main advances in developing and comparing algae-based biosensorsand other analytical possibilities for the identification of potentially toxic pollutants and their possibleapplications in environmental analysis.",8.96,True,1,166.04400634765625,340.1374816894531,False,False,False,H2
