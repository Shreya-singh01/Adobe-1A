"Potentially toxic pollutants can bioaccumulate in the environment from both naturaland human sources. Human activities, such as mining, smelting, mineral refining, andindustrial production, are mainly responsible for most pollution in the natural environment.Industrial effluents may result in several risks to aquatic and human health contaminatingwater resources through runoff or intentional release of wastewater [1]. Mercury, lead,cadmium, chromium, and arsenic have no biological function and can cause mental, genetic,and morphological abnormalities in humans [2]. Furthermore, these toxic elements arepersistent in the environment, and harmful to humans, animals, and plants even at low con-centrations (Hg: 0.003 mg L−1; Pb: 6 mg L−1; Cd: 10 mg L−1; As and Cr: 0.05 mg L−1) [2].Many herbicides, such as simazine, exhibit similar environmental persistence and toxicity,posing a significant risk to aquatic ecosystems by inhibiting photosynthetic activity [3,4].",9.46,False,1,165.97500610351562,636.6148071289062,False,False,False,body

"Furthermore, the widespread use of these chemicals can lead to groundwater contamina-tion, further complicating the challenge of maintaining safe water quality standards [5,6].The bioaccumulation of potentially toxic elements can cause health problems, such asintoxication, cancer, and mental disorders [4].Chemical analyses of water and sediments have been conducted to monitor toxic el-ements in aquatic environments [7,8]. The analytical techniques most frequently used toidentify and quantify the presence of elements in aquatic environments are Flame AtomicAbsorption Spectrometry (F AAS), Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (GFAAS), Flame Atomic Emission Spectrometry (F AES), Inductively Coupled Plasma OpticalEmission Spectrometry (ICP OES), Microwave Induced Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry(MIP OES), and Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP–MS) [8,9]. Althoughthose analytical techniques have been reported for metal ion determination in water andsediment samples, with high accuracy and precision, they can be considered expensive,requiring trained personnel, and laboratory settings [5,10,11]. In this sense, research into in-novative and economical alternatives for the specific and rapid detection of these pollutantsis crucial.In this context, biosensors have emerged as a modern analytical strategy for identify-ing and quantifying pollutants in aquatic environments. Unlike physicochemical analyzers,which quantify toxic substances, biosensors can measure toxicity. They offer severaladvantages, including lower analysis costs and faster response than spectrometric tech-niques [12,13]. Biosensors work as devices connected to biological recognition elements,which are associated with a transducer that converts a stimulus into a measurable unit ofenergy. Whole algae, cyanobacteria—or algae components—can be utilized as biologicalrecognition elements in biosensors [12].Algae is a heterogeneous group inhabiting various planet regions: oceans, rivers, lakes,soils, and organism surfaces [14,15]. There are two main types of algae: macroalgae, alsoknown as seaweeds, inhabiting coastal zones and encompass varieties (green, brown, andred algae); and microalgae, found in both benthic and coastal habitats, distributed through-out the oceans as phytoplankton [16]. Furthermore, algae are a promising alternative forcarbon sequestration due to photosynthesis [15].Microalgae possess physiological and biochemical characteristics that make thempromising candidates for application in biosensors aimed at monitoring heavy metalsand pesticides in contaminated environments [17–19]. These unicellular organisms areable to detect and respond to toxic contaminants through well-established detoxificationmechanisms, which include initial adsorption at the cell wall, followed by intracellularaccumulation and activation of specific antioxidant systems. In response to heavy metals,species such as Chlorella vulgaris and Scenedesmus obliquus perform passive adsorptionon the cell surface, utilizing functional groups such as carboxyl and hydroxyl to retainmetal ions. Metals may also be chelated by metallothioneins and phytochelatins, whichprotect the cell by sequestering these ions in cellular compartments such as vacuoles [19].Additionally, microalgae activate antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD)and catalase (CAT), which neutralize reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by oxidativestress, thereby preserving cellular viability [17].For pesticides, microalgae like Scenedesmus obliquus promote compound decompo-sition into less toxic by-products, such as phthalic acid, via the action of enzymes likeglutathione S-transferase (GST). This process is further supported by antioxidants, includ-ing glutathione (GSH) and the ascorbate cycle, which mitigate the oxidative stress inducedby the pesticide, demonstrating the ability of these microalgae to act as effective biosensorsfor environmental monitoring of both organic and inorganic pollutants [18]. Algae can beused as biosensors for chemical elements, providing an accurate analysis of the potentialrisk to human and environmental well-being [20–22]. Thus, algae-based biosensors for thedetection of potentially toxic metal ions are an interesting topic aiming at environmentaland agroecological contamination problems.

"Classical analytical methods for detecting potentially toxic metal ions, such as gravi-metric and volumetric assays, were widely used in the mid-20th century. Gravimetricanalysis, which measures the mass of an isolated substance in an insoluble form, andvolumetric analysis, which determines the concentration of the substance based on thevolume of a reagent solution, were fundamental to analytical chemistry [20–25]. However,these methods have limitations, including low sensitivity, detection limits above 10 mg L−1,and the need for significant quantities of reagents, making them less suitable for modernenvironmental analysis [26,27].Recent advancements in analytical technologies have addressed the limitations ofclassical methods for the identification and quantification of potentially toxic metals, yield-ing reliable results characterized by precision, accuracy, repeatability, and reproducibility.Atomic spectrometry techniques, including atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) andplasma-based methods, play a crucial role in metal determination [7]. The choice of an-alytical technique depends on factors such as the number of elements to be determined,sample form (solid or solution), sensitivity, linear range, interferences, and the cost andmaintenance of the instrumentation [8,28]. AAS employs various atomizers, such as flameor graphite furnace, which differ in sensitivity and operational efficiency; the graphitefurnace offers higher sensitivity with lower detection limits (in µg L−1) compared to theflame atomizer (in mg L−1), albeit at a higher operational cost [7].Plasma-based analytical techniques, such as inductively coupled plasma optical emis-sion spectrometry (ICP OES) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS),have gained prominence due to their high sensitivity and multielemental capabilities, en-abling the determination of concentrations ranging from µg L−1 to mg L−1 [9,29]. Despitetheir advantages, these techniques are often hindered by high acquisition and operationalcosts due to substantial argon gas consumption [29]. Given the ongoing exploration of newanalytical methods, biosensors have emerged as a promising alternative, offering significantbenefits in application, cost, versatility, and robustness by detecting signals produced fromthe interaction between analytes and biological components, which correlates with metalconcentrations [5,30].",9.67,False,3,166.0050048828125,396.59051513671875,False,False,False,body

"The detection of pesticides in environmental ecosystems can be achieved throughvarious analytical techniques, including gas chromatography (GC) and liquid chromatogra-phy (LC). GC is predominantly employed for volatile and non-polar compounds, utilizingdetectors such as electron capture detectors (ECD), flame photometric detectors (FPD), andmass spectrometry (MS) for enhanced sensitivity [31,32]. High-performance liquid chro-matography (HPLC), on the other hand, is particularly suitable for high-polarity pesticidesand can be paired with classical detectors such as ultraviolet (UV) and fluorescence, as wellas MS, which offers exceptional sensitivity without the need for derivatization [33].In addition, capillary electrophoresis (CE) is an effective analytical technique thatrequires minimal reagents and sample volumes, providing high separation efficiency.Despite its limitations in sensitivity due to the small capillary diameter, CE is often coupledwith sensitive detection methods, including MS (Sánchez-Hernández et al., 2014) [34],and integrated with pre-concentration techniques. Recent studies have demonstratedthe application of innovative approaches, such as electrokinetic supercharging (EKS) andbiomimetic immunoassays (BI-CE), for efficient pesticide detection, offering more accessiblealternatives to conventional methods [32,35,36].Recent developments in plasma-based techniques, such as Inductively CoupledPlasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES) and Inductively Coupled Plasma MassSpectrometry (ICP-MS), have significantly improved detection capabilities. These methodsallow multielement analysis with detection limits down to µg L−1 or less but also havehigh operational costs [37–42]. Challenges of these advanced techniques include theirsusceptibility to spectral and non-spectral interferences and the need for extensive samplepreparation [42–45]. In response to these challenges, there is increasing interest in thedevelopment of alternative methods, such as algal biosensors. These biosensors provide asustainable and cost-effective solution for in situ metal ion and pesticide detection by lever-aging biological interactions for sensitive and robust environmental monitoring [3,6,46].",9.92,False,4,165.97500610351562,89.63335418701172,False,False,False,body

"Algae, as photosynthetic organisms found in various aquatic habitats, are essentialfor the health and biodiversity of aquatic ecosystems [47]. They act as primary producersin food chains, provide nourishment for invertebrates and fish, and contribute to nutrientrecycling and oxygen production [48]. In addition, algae help maintain the stability ofcoastal environments by filtering pollutants and preventing coastal erosion [49]. Dueto their rich composition of vitamins, proteins, lipids, pigments, polysaccharides, andbioactive compounds, algae are utilized in various industries such as food, cosmetics, andpharmaceuticals [50,51].Algae have only been used in developing biosensors in the last two decades [14]. In thissense, the use of algae as biosensors has been reported as a low-cost and eco-friendly optionfor environmental monitoring [52–55]. Their cell walls rich in polysaccharides, proteins,and lipids (Figure 2) give them a high capacity for adsorbing contaminant molecules, suchas metal ions and pesticides, through functional groups that offer negatively charged sites:carboxyl, hydroxyl, amino, sulfate, and carboxylate; while physiological processes, such asactive transport, contribute to the internalization of these substances [56–58]. The carboxylgroup is recognized as a key factor in adsorption, with carboxylic moieties able to bindmetal ions, such as Cd2+, through two distinct mechanisms: either by replacing the H+ inthe carboxyl group (type-I) or, after prolonged exposure, forming carboxylates (type-II) [59].This adsorption process follows a biphasic mechanism. In the initial, rapid phase, metalions are adsorbed by various components of the microalgal cell wall and its functionalgroups [60]. This non-metabolic phase is influenced by several factors, including pH,temperature, metal concentration, biosorbent dosage, and contact time, with the microalgalstrain, contact time, and pH being the most critical parameters [61], while temperatureprimarily affects the kinetics rather than the capacity [62].",9.89,False,4,166.0850067138672,454.8643798828125,False,False,False,body

"Additionally, the nature of the metal ion also affects the process; cationic metal uptakeis enhanced at higher pH, while anionic ion removal is more efficient at lower pH [64,65].In the second, metabolic phase, metal ions are absorbed and accumulated within the cellsthrough active transport and binding to proteins like phytochelatins or metallothioneins,making this phase slower [17,18,65]. Unlike the first phase, the second phase is dependenton factors such as temperature and the metabolic state, as active metal transport requiresenergy [19]. This affinity for metal ions has led to the development of algae-based biosen-sors, such as whole-cell biosensors constructed utilizing the microalga Chlorella vulgaris asthe recognition component, with its fluorescence response employed as the measurementparameter to detect the presence of titanium dioxide (TiO2) and silver (Ag) nanoparticlesin water. This biosensor demonstrated significant sensitivity, with a detection limit of1 × 10−3 mg L−1 [66–71].Similarly for pesticides, hydroxyl, carboxyl, and amine groups have been identified asthe predominant active surface groups in the adsorption of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid(2,4-D) by Gracilaria verrucosa [67]. The cell wall of microalgae is composed of a fibrillarmatrix of carbohydrates, intercellular spaces, and sulfated polysaccharides, which facilitatethe adsorption of organic contaminants from water [68,69]. Pesticide adsorption dependson two aspects: the growth of the microalgae, and the chemical structure of the pesticideand organism-related factors (microalgae) [70]. Therefore, several studies use microalgaefor bioremediation and the development of sensors for pesticides. Moro et al. (2018) usedthe inhibition of microalgae fluorescence to identify pesticides in seawater. In this study,fluorescence parameters of several species of microalgae were analyzed in the presence ofthree common marine pesticides that act as photosynthesis inhibitors. The three pollutantswere detected in a 10-min interval, at concentrations ranging from ng L−1 to µg L−1. Thedifferent species of microalgae demonstrated slightly different sensitivities to pesticides,with Chlorella mirabilis being the most sensitive [71].",9.72,False,5,165.89500427246094,296.00469970703125,False,False,False,body

"Algae-based biosensors were initially employed in the 1980s and 1990s, involvingthe cultivation of algae that underwent alterations in their cellular growth and photosyn-thetic activity in the presence of pollutants [12,14]. Biosensors are currently applied in awide range of areas such as industrial process control, food control, and environmentalmonitoring [5,6]. Biosensors are considered highly promising tools for the detection of po-tentially toxic pollutants due to their specificity, low cost, portability, real-time monitoringcapability, fast response time, ease of handling, compactness, sensitivity, user-friendliness,and reliability [72,73]. Furthermore, biosensors have a fast response time, are portable,and can be used for in situ applications, as is their ability to assess the biotoxicity andbioavailable of pollutants in living beings.

"combination of nanotechnology, biotechnology, and microelectronics. These analyticaldevices rely primarily on a biological sensing component capable of recognizing the targetanalyte with the signal transduced by an appropriate transduction element [72–75]. Theconstruction of an effective biosensor involves several steps: selection of the bioreceptor,characterization and adaptation to be used as a sensor, selection of a transducer, systemassembly, signal amplification, and verification of the real efficiency of the biosensor. Abioreceptor or biological recognition element is a biological entity that specifically reactswith the molecule to be analyzed and produces a measurable signal. Meanwhile, thetransducer is the device that converts the signal from the bioreceptor into electrical energy.Biosensors can utilize different analytes, biological receptors, and transducers. The carefulselection of each biosensor component is crucial, as it directly affects the sensitivity andspecificity of detection; therefore, optimization is necessary to adjust the biosensor to thespecific pollutant and environmental conditions [12,14,74].Conceptually, all biomolecules and molecular assemblies have the ability to recognizetarget analytes and then become a bio-receiver. The first elements to be used in biorecogni-tion for biosensors were elements of a living system [75]. Biorecognition elements mainlyinclude whole cells, enzymes, molecularly imprinted polymers, and others, such as ap-tamers and antibodies, with greater application in the healthcare field [74]. Bacteria [76],yeasts [77], cyanobacteria [78], and microalgae [66] have been utilized as bioreceptors inthese devices’ fabrication. The principle of using bio-recognition elements in algae-basedbiosensors for the detection of potentially toxic pollutants is based on the ability of theseelements to selectively and specifically bind to the target compound [79]. When the algaebinds to the toxic compound, it triggers a signal detected and quantified by the biosensor.This signal is typically a change in fluorescence, conductivity, or other physical or chemicalproperty that can be measured to determine the concentration of the pesticides, chemicals,toxic compounds, and metal ions in the sample [80–83].Among the various biosensors, those based on algae have shown a good perspectiveon potentially toxic pollutant detection. These biosensors are adaptable to adverse condi-tions, reproducible with low nutrient requirements, and more stable than enzyme-basedbiosensors. Microalgae biosensors utilize intact microalgal cells to detect pesticides bymonitoring changes in photosynthesis, measured through variations in oxygen productionor chlorophyll fluorescence. A paper-based biosensor with whole cells of the microalgaeChlamydomonas reinhardtii immobilized on a paper substrate for herbicide detection throughchlorophyll fluorescence has been developed [48,54]. The results showed a decrease in vari-able fluorescence inversely proportional to the herbicide concentration (0.5–200 nmol L−1),indicating a linear relationship in the measured dose–response curves and a limit of detec-tion of 4 pmol L−1. In addition, the biosensor demonstrated satisfactory storage stabilityfor up to three weeks. Over the past two decades, microalgae-based biosensors have beenextensively developed for pollutant detection due to their high sensitivity (in the µg L−1",9.82,False,6,165.97500610351562,89.63335418701172,False,False,False,body
"range), sustainability, and ease of handling, since microalgae can be cultivated on a largescale at a low cost, and remain active in high-pH environments, reducing contamination byother microorganisms. By using bio-recognition elements specific to the target metal ion,algae-based biosensors can provide susceptible and selective detection of potentially toxicpollutants in environmental samples. This allows for rapid and reliable monitoring of waterquality and the early detection of contamination events, enabling timely interventions toprotect human health and the environment [54,75–78].One of the main steps in biosensor development is the immobilization of the biologi-cal recognition element. In the case of an algae-based biosensor, the microalgae cells areimmobilized, on a surface or solid matrix (as long their detection ability is maintained) orused as a cell suspension [14]. In addition, immobilization is crucial to secure the stability,reproducibility, practicability, and durability of the biosensor [78,79]. Different immobi-lization procedures have been adopted based on the suitability of the biological elementand transducing system, involving physical methods like entrapment, encapsulation, andadsorption or chemical methods like covalent bonding and cross-linking [20,22,54,84,85].",9.99,False,6,166.09500122070312,579.2313232421875,False,False,False,body

"Physical methods are primarily used to immobilize whole cells or cellular organelles. Thethickness and porosity of membranes used for encapsulation and entrapment significantlyaffect the performance of biocomponents, often resulting in reduced sensitivity and slowerresponse times [79,86]. In this sense, a study examining the fluorescence of various mi-croalgae species (C. vulgaris, P. subcapitata, and C. reinhardtii) immobilized with a calciumalginate matrix further immobilized in an inorganic silica matrix as a biosensor demon-strated that the immobilized microalgae exhibited lower sensitivity in comparison withthe algae in suspension (limits of detection 0.001 µmol L−1 and <0.001 µmol L−1). Thesefindings suggest that the immobilization of whole-cell biosensors does not compromisetheir functionality. Furthermore, photosynthetic activity measured by fluorescence de-creased in a dose-dependent manner consistently across all three species [86], indicatingthat immobilization can protect cells (resulting in greater durability of the biosensor) andallow the study of highly toxic metal ions and in larger quantities without dilutions.After preparation, the algae-based biosensor is exposed to the medium containingthe analyte. At this stage, the immobilized algae are put directly in contact with the targetsubstances (Figure 3). The high biological selectivity of the algal receptors enables thespecific interaction of the analyte, such as metal ions, through biochemical interactions.Certain algae species demonstrate a remarkable affinity for metal ions such as Cd2+, Cr6+,and Zn2+ [46,52,55]. The interaction between the analyte and the biological componentsof the biosensor triggers biochemical changes in the algae, which are essential for subse-quent signal transduction. These biochemical alterations, resulting from the algae–analyteinteraction, are measured by detectable optical and electrochemical signals through physic-ochemical transducers. Electrochemical biosensors function by detecting chemical reactionsthrough variations in the electrical properties of the solution. These systems require athree-electrode configuration: a working electrode, a counter electrode, and a reference elec-trode [80,82]. The working electrode serves as the transducer where the reaction takes place;the counter electrode completes the circuit and applies current to the working electrode;and the reference electrode maintains a stable potential. Electrochemical biosensors are fur-ther categorized into conductometric, potentiometric, and amperometric types [73]. Opticalbiosensors, on the other hand, comprise an optical transducer and bioreceptor molecules,converting biological events into electrical signals by inducing changes in the light’s ab-sorption, transmission, reflection, refraction, phase, amplitude, frequency, or polarizationin response to the physicochemical alterations caused by biorecognition events [83].",9.79,False,7,166.11500549316406,89.71162414550781,False,False,False,body

"The use of the microalgae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii as a bioindicator for the pres-ence of pesticides has been investigated [82]. Electrochemical biosensors to monitor themetabolic activity of the algae through the detection of O2, H2O2, and H3O+/OH−(pH-related ions) were carried out. The platinum black biosensor showed the highest sensitivityfor O2 and H2O2, whilst Pt/IrO2 showed the greatest sensitivity for pH. In optical biosen-sors, this transduction typically involves measuring changes in the natural fluorescence ofthe algae. The fluorescence intensity varies according to the analyte concentration, allowingthe indirect quantification of the target substance. Alternatively, electrochemical biosen-sors can monitor changes in current or potential generated by the biological interaction.The choice of transducer type depends on the specific properties of the analyte and thecharacteristics of the developed biosensor [22].Algae-based biosensors can be utilized for the specific detection of potentially pollut-ing elements through specific response patterns. The identification of a specific elementby means of a biosensor occurs through the comparative analysis of the response patternsgenerated by different strains of microalgae. Each element induces a distinct alteration inthe fluorescence of the microalgae, which, when recorded and compared with a databaseof known patterns, allows for the identification of the contaminant. Podola and Melko-nian (2005) studied various strains of microalgae as biosensors, among which the strainsTetraselmis cordiformis and Scherffelia dubia demonstrated high sensitivity to herbicides suchas diuron and isoproturon, creating a response pattern that enabled the precise identificationof these compounds in water based on prior standardization with reference substances [87].Another alternative for specific detection of potentially polluting elements is the use ofgenetically modified microalgae that are resistant to certain compounds [88,89]. Haigh-Flórez et al. (2014) developed a dual-head biosensor employing strains of Dictyosphaeriumchlorelloides, which are sensitive and resistant to simazine, immobilized in porous siliconefilms. The sensitive strain shows a significant decrease in O2 production in the presenceof the herbicide, while the resistant strain remains unaffected, enabling selective detec-tion of the compound. The photosynthetic activity of the strains was monitored usingan integrated luminescent O2 sensor. The device provides in situ herbicide concentrationmeasurements every 180 min, with a detection limit of 12 µg L−1 and a working range of50–800 µg L−1 [90].Biosensors for specific detection and biosensors for general toxicity detection differin terms of prior preparation and analysis methods. Biosensors using specific responsepatterns are designed to identify and quantify individual compounds, such as herbicides,through the analysis of differentiated responses from various strains of microalgae, previ-ously evaluated against these contaminants and thus defining a standard response. Thistype of biosensor utilizes more than one microalgal strain and compares the variationsin chlorophyll fluorescence of these microalgae exposed to standards and environmentalsamples [87]. In contrast, biosensors aimed at detecting general toxicity may use onlyone strain and assess the overall impact of all contaminants present in a sample, withoutcomparison to previously established response patterns. These biosensors measure totaltoxicity, reflecting the aggregated response of the microalgae to the environmental sample,without determining which element is responsible for the generated toxicity [14].",9.63,False,8,165.78599548339844,89.45906829833984,False,False,False,body

Optical biosensors were also de-veloped, exploring the inhibition of electron transfer in terms of variations in chlorophyllfluorescence emission in the presence of pollutants [91].

Metal can influence fluorescence,making it a valuable indicator for biomonitoring environmental pollution, particularly inaquatic systems [92]. Consequently, algal biomass emerges as an economical and efficientmaterial for the selective removal and recovery of metal ions from industrial wastewa-ter or other sources [93,94].

"In addition to the fluorescence generated by photosynthesis, the fluorescence of othercomponents that bind to metal ions can be quantified. A recent study developed an opticalbiosensor based on the intracellular fluorescence of microalgae genetically modified tofacilitate the entry of metal ions into their cells [95]. The absorption and intracellularstorage of metal ions in microalgae, focusing on the species Chlamydomonas reinhardtii,were investigated. The production of the biosensor through the insertion of a plasmidwith fluorescent proteins fused to a metallothionein and in vitro metal ion binding studieswas evaluated. The results highlighted the biosensor’s ability to quantify free toxic metalions in microalgae. Among the metal ions evaluated, the biosensor presented a highersensitivity for Hg2+ followed by Cd2+, Pb2+, Zn2+, and Cu2+. This study demonstrates thepotential of microalgae to be used in diverse and efficient ways as biosensors [95]. Alongwith fluorescence, dissolved oxygen is also an important parameter for evaluating thepresence of pollutants, as it is directly related to the photosynthetic activity of the algae.Another advantage of biosensors lies in their versatility, as they can be effectivelyutilized not only for environmental analysis but also for the detection of pesticide residuesin food products.

"Amperometric measurement and evaluation of photosynthetic activity based on oxy-gen production have proven to be a promising technique for developing algae-basedenvironmental biosensors [97]. These biosensors measure the reduction of a redox mediatoror monitor oxygen production through an electrode. Oxygen electrode-based biosensorshave demonstrated good sensitivity, long operational life, and suitability for aquatic envi-ronmental monitoring [98]. Photosynthetic response as a function of light intensity, alongwith the amperometric activity, while the microalgae and cyanobacteria were in contact withthe pollutant, has been investigated [73,78]. In this system, a sensor using Pseudokirchneriellasubcapitata, Desmodesmus quadricauda, Microcystis aeruginosa, and Synechococcus elongatusin an electrochemical sensor for toxicological detection was developed, detecting the con-taminant through changes in the electrical properties of the solution [80,82]. The materialpresented satisfactory results with a quick response time, affordability, ease of use, and thepotential for development into a fully automated system [78].Conductometric biosensors operate based on the production or consumption of ionicspecies during metabolic processes, causing changes in the electrical conductivity of theelectrolytic solution, which can be measured to determine the sensor’s response [52,80].Potentiometric biosensors convert biological interactions between the sensor and the con-taminant into measurable electrical signals [99]. On the other hand, amperometric biosen-sors measure changes in current resulting from the reduction or oxidation of electroactivespecies on the electrode surface, with the potential between the working and referenceelectrodes kept constant during current measurement [100].A biosensor based on Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata to determine the presence of di-uron, simetryn, simazine, and atrazine in water, was investigated, focused on oxygenproduction, along with fluorescence intensity [101]. In 10 min, the biosensor showed a limitof detection of 1.0 µg L−1 for diuron, and 10 µg L−1 for simetryn, simazine, and atrazineusing a sample volume of only 200 µL, demonstrating that the material is fast, low-cost, andeco-friendly. The monitoring of atrazine in water was also investigated using a portablemicroalgae Scenedesmus acutus and Monoraphidium contortum sensor [86]. The microalgaewere immobilized in polyelectrolyte-surfactant-carbon nanotube self-assembled materialcast on a screen-printed graphite electrode, which was able to monitor the oxygen reductionthrough photosynthesis inhibition with a detection limit of 0.11 µmol L−1, indicating apromising response for river samples. Also, the biosensor presented satisfactory stability,maintaining its integrity over 5 months of immersion in a freshwater algae medium atroom temperature. The use of microbial fuel cells (MFC) to develop a photosyntheticMFC sensor for detecting the presence of formaldehyde in water has been studied [21]. Toinoculate the MFCs, two species of microalgae from a pilot high-rate algal pond (HRAP)were used: Scenedesmus obliquus and Chlorella luteoviridis. The photo MFC sensor wasable to demonstrate the interference of the contaminant in the photosynthetic activity ofthe algae, detecting the presence of formaldehyde in concentrations ranging from 0.001to 0.02%. In addition, the electrogenic activity of the microalgae in the sensor demon-strated a cost-effective and rapid analytical method for detection compared to traditionalbiological analysis.An electrochemical biosensor based on the green microalga Scenedesmus sp.

"structed by immobilizing Scenedesmus sp. microalgae on a glassy carbon electrode surfaceusing bovine serum albumin. Its responses were based on the chronoamperometric currentsgenerated by the activity of alkaline phosphatase. The sensitivity was verified with a halfinhibition concentration of 0.26 µg L−1 for Cd2+ at pH 8.5 and 107 cells mL−1. Meanwhile,an electrochemical biosensor using algae (Desmodesmus quadricauda and Pseudokirchneriellasubcapitata) and cyanobacteria (Microcystis aeruginosa and Synechococcus elongatus) has beenstudied [78]. The strategy involved immobilizing the microalgae and cyanobacteria alongwith a mediator in a Sephadex gel structure, allowing the detection of microbial reduction ofthe mediator. The results showed a good correlation with the reference analytical methods,such as the Algal Growth Inhibition Test and the Microtox Test, highlighting the ease ofhandling and reduced measurement time as advantages of this new biosensor.An alternative approach to the development of algae-based biosensors involves utiliz-ing algal biomass as a sustainable substrate for the chemical coating of silver nanoparticles,which can be employed for the electrochemical detection of pesticides. According toAmeen et al. (2023), this study used self-grown biomass of Spirulina platensis, modifiedwith chemical silver, as a powder amplifier in the construction of a carbon paste electrode,with 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate as a conductive ligand. The de-termination of atropine was conducted using voltammetric methods, demonstrating thatthe electrochemical behavior of atropine is pH dependent, with pH 10.0 identified as theoptimal condition for analysis. The fabricated sensor exhibited a linear response withinthe concentration range of 0.01–800 µM, achieving an impressive detection limit of 5 nMfor atropine. The results also confirmed the stability, reproducibility, and selectivity of thesensor, as evidenced by recovery percentages of 94.48–101.58% for atropine sulfate vialsand 98.01–101.3% for water samples [101].Table 1 presents the main articles focused on using algae or their components forapplication in biosensors for the detection of potentially toxic metal ions, covering theperiod from 2014 to the present. As can be seen in Table 1, the genus of algae commonlyused for biosensing is Scenedesmus, specifically from the species Scenedesmus obliquus,Scenedesmus acutus, Scenedesmus sp., and Scenedesmus subspicatus. However, research shouldcontinue comparing the performance of the strains of algae as cell biosensors. The limits ofdetection using algae-based biosensors range from 0.2 mmol L−1 to 0.9 mg L−1 for differentcontaminants, such as diuron, Cd, Cu, and Zn. Thus, in general, algae-based biosensorsoffer several advantages for application in biosensors for the detection of potentially toxicmetal ions, such as sensitivity and selectivity, fast response, low production cost (less than2 USD per-sample) [53], satisfactory stability, and efficiency, indicating these devices as aneffective analytical tool for environmental monitoring.",9.72,False,11,165.97500610351562,89.53923034667969,False,False,False,body

"The application of algae-based biosensors for detecting potentially toxic pollutantsis quite promising, and a key challenge is the attainment of high sensitivity, specificity,stability, and selectivity of the electrode response. The production costs of biosensors inlarge quantities must also be considered. It should be noted that the commercializationof biosensor technology has lagged significantly behind research results, as reflected bypublications with various methods and materials that can be used. The logic behind theslow and limited transfer of technology can be attributed to cost considerations and someobstacles related to the regulation and compliance with health legislation.Meanwhile, analytical techniques such as spectrometric techniques guarantee excellentresults in the detection of potentially toxic metal ions, with some of them allowing thequantification of toxic metal ions at trace concentrations. However, there is a growinginterest in developing alternative analytical methods, offering a sustainable, efficient, andcost-effective solution for potential toxic element detection, as is the case with metal ions.Biosensors emerge as an excellent alternative considering their costs, versatility, and robust-ness for the quantification of metal ions in environmental samples. In particular, opticaland electrochemical biosensors exhibit significant analytical performance characterized bysensitivity, stability, and detection limits, making them promising tools for environmentalmonitoring. Optical biosensors have demonstrated high sensitivity, with detection lim-its ranging from 0.001 to 0.11 µmol L−1 for various contaminants, while electrochemicalbiosensors display detection limits as low as 0.11 µmol L−1 for atrazine, with long-termstability of up to five months [21,84,85].Algae-based biosensors exhibit notable versatility, allowing for application in diverseenvironmental contexts, while their potential for low-cost production enhances their acces-sibility. However, limitations in reproducibility and specificity restrict their effectiveness indetecting multiple pollutants, and the complexity of optimizing immobilization techniquesand simplified transducers presents additional challenges for performance improvement.Advances in nanotechnology offer promising avenues to improve biosensor functionalityand facilitate the creation of innovative sensing platforms.In terms of future perspectives, the success of using whole algae in biosensor pro-duction is noteworthy, but other new materials to optimize the performance of metal ionsensors for specific applications are still necessary. Notably, advances in nanotechnologyshow great promise in enhancing biosensor performance and enabling the development ofnovel materials and detection platforms. To address this issue, there is a growing trendtoward developing user-friendly biosensors that can be easily assembled and utilized byindividuals without a scientific background [53]. This shift towards more accessible tech-nology signals a promising direction for the future of biosensor development. In addition,bioinformatics tools and data analysis algorithms can improve the accuracy and reliabilityof biosensor measurements, and artificial intelligence facilitates the analysis of complexdata sets generated by biosensors, leading to faster and more accurate results.",9.84,False,17,166.0050048828125,249.94139099121094,False,False,False,body

"In summary, algae represent a promising component of life and biomass on our planet.In addition to being promising in chemical and pharmaceutical biotechnology, algae offer aunique range of bio-compounds that enable this biomass to work within a fully sustainableplan, producing oxygen alongside biosensor performance. This alternative could overcomesome disadvantages of powerful and well-consolidated analytical techniques, such asspectrometric and electrochemical techniques, as well as the recent integration of artificialintelligence to support quantitative or qualitative analytical profiles. Improving environ-mental quality has become a primary objective of research worldwide, inherently tied tocontrolling and monitoring environmental parameters. These issues demand continuous,rapid, and sensitive monitoring systems capable of detecting toxic pollutants in water andsediment samples, given the extremely negative effects on the environment and livingorganisms. In this regard, with the advances and issues of sustainable biosensors, algaebiomass holds significant potential for new technologies and innovative applications.",9.96,False,18,166.09500122070312,105.318359375,False,False,False,body
