The refers to policies adopted at the national level that directly address 12challenges which uniquely or disproportionately aﬀect women and girls, including violence against women and girls (96 policies), women’s economic security (94 policies), or unpaid care work (3 policies). For instance, a policy addressing women’s economic security may target women to receive household cash transfers or prioritize for benefits a subset of workers in which women are significantly overrepresented. Colombia implemented the most gender sensitive policies (31), followed by Honduras (17) and oPt (16). Iraq and Libya had none. Only three countries – Burundi, oPt, and Ukraine – implemented policies directly supporting unpaid care. Women took on a greater burden of unpaid caregiving, including caring for sick relatives during the pandemic. Failing to support this labor disadvantages women and undermines their empowerment.",9.7,True,8,54.0,189.16000366210938,False,False,False,body

"Despite implementing gender sensitive COVID-19 policies, the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on women and girls remains felt across HRP countries. The pandemic eroded progress on gender-based violence, economic empowerment, education, and healthcare. COVID-19 and its secondary eﬀects left women and girls in a worse position than before the pandemic and increased vulnerability to compounding crises, such as food insecurity or conflict. The pandemic set back progress on domestic violence, with the percent of respondents who believe there are acceptable circumstances to hit a partner increasing by 2 percentage points to 19 percent, according to a 20-country survey.   Women’s 13economic security also remains at risk. Globally, women’s poverty continues to increase, with more women in poverty than men.  Over 11 million girls remain at risk of not returning to school, reducing their employment and earning opportunities 14and increasing the risk of early marriage and pregnancy.  Many women and girls also lost access to reproductive care as 15healthcare systems were strained by COVID-19, contributing to maternal mortality, unwanted pregnancies, disease, and school dropouts. Global estimates suggest that the pandemic caused a 37 percent increase in maternal deaths.  Across Latin 16America and the Caribbean, 1 in 4 girls did not have access to family planning services.  As data remains limited, the full 17repercussions of the pandemic on women and girls may not be known for years to come.",9.12,True,9,54.0,85.16000366210938,False,False,False,body
