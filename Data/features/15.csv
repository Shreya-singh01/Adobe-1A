"Abstract: Numerical modeling is a signiﬁcant tool to understand the dynamic characteristics ofcontaminants transport in groundwater. The automatic calibration of highly parametrized andcomputationally intensive numerical models for the simulation of contaminant transport in thegroundwater ﬂow system is a challenging task. While existing methods use general optimizationtechniques to achieve automatic calibration, the large numbers of numerical model evaluationsrequired in the calibration process lead to high computing overhead and limit the efﬁciency of modelcalibration. This paper presents a Bayesian optimization (BO) method for efﬁcient calibration ofnumerical models of groundwater contaminant transport. A Bayes model is built to fully representcalibration criteria and derive the objective function for model calibration. The efﬁciency of modelcalibration is made possible by the probabilistic surrogate model and the expected improvementacquisition function in BO. The probabilistic surrogate model approximates the computationallyexpensive objective function with a closed-form expression that can be computed efﬁciently, whilethe expected improvement acquisition function proposes the most promising model parameters toimprove the ﬁtness to the calibration criteria and reduce the uncertainty of the surrogate model.These schemes allow us to ﬁnd the optimized model parameters effectively by using a small numberof numerical model evaluations. Two case studies for the calibration of the Cr(VI) transport modeldemonstrate that the BO method is effective and efﬁcient in the inversion of hypothetical model pa-rameters, the minimization of the objective function, and the adaptation of different model calibrationcriteria. Speciﬁcally, this promising performance is achieved within 200 numerical model evaluations,which substantially reduces the computing budget for model calibration.",9.0,True,1,166.01699829101562,283.1953430175781,False,False,False,H2
