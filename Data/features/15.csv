"Abstract: Numerical modeling is a signiﬁcant tool to understand the dynamic characteristics ofcontaminants transport in groundwater. The automatic calibration of highly parametrized andcomputationally intensive numerical models for the simulation of contaminant transport in thegroundwater ﬂow system is a challenging task. While existing methods use general optimizationtechniques to achieve automatic calibration, the large numbers of numerical model evaluationsrequired in the calibration process lead to high computing overhead and limit the efﬁciency of modelcalibration. This paper presents a Bayesian optimization (BO) method for efﬁcient calibration ofnumerical models of groundwater contaminant transport. A Bayes model is built to fully representcalibration criteria and derive the objective function for model calibration. The efﬁciency of modelcalibration is made possible by the probabilistic surrogate model and the expected improvementacquisition function in BO. The probabilistic surrogate model approximates the computationallyexpensive objective function with a closed-form expression that can be computed efﬁciently, whilethe expected improvement acquisition function proposes the most promising model parameters toimprove the ﬁtness to the calibration criteria and reduce the uncertainty of the surrogate model.These schemes allow us to ﬁnd the optimized model parameters effectively by using a small numberof numerical model evaluations. Two case studies for the calibration of the Cr(VI) transport modeldemonstrate that the BO method is effective and efﬁcient in the inversion of hypothetical model pa-rameters, the minimization of the objective function, and the adaptation of different model calibrationcriteria.

"The contaminant transport in groundwater ﬂow systems is a concealed, long-term,invertible process that has become a serious environmental problem and poses threats tosustainable development [1–4]. Understanding the dynamic characteristics of contaminantmigration and retention is crucial for pollution assessment and contaminant remediation insoils, sites, and groundwater.The numerical modeling techniques offer effective and robust tools to quantify, simu-late, and predict the process of contaminants transport in groundwater ﬂow systems. Overthe past few decades, an enormous number of groundwater numerical modeling studieshave been devoted to simulating the transportation and fate of contaminants [5–13]. Thenumerical modeling of contaminant transport is dependent on the dynamic governingequations, which include a series of model parameters that affect the model solutions, i.e.,the simulation results.

"methods, numerical modeling is confronted with the non-uniqueness of simulation results,which limits the accuracy of simulation results. Aiming to generate accurate and meaning-ful simulation results, extensive efforts have been made in model calibration [2,14–24].Initially, the model calibration is conducted manually. However, calibration of themodel with only a few parameters would lead to a tedious and time-consuming “trial-and-error” process. Automatic model calibration, which is generally cast as an optimizationproblem, greatly alleviates the human workload to tune the model parameters and im-proves the efﬁciency of parameter calibration. To solve the highly nonlinear optimizationproblem derived from automatic model calibration, common optimization techniques suchas gradient-based methods and global optimization methods are generally used. Thegradient-based optimization is adopted in most model calibration approaches, such asthose in the literature [25–27] and well-known software such as PEST [14], UCODE [28], andDakota [29]. To ﬁnd the minimum of objective functions, this category of methods involvesmultiple iterations to update the solution in terms of gradients. To estimate the gradientwith respect to N model parameters,N + 1(forward difference) or 2N + 1 (center difference)times of numerical modeling are required. Moreover, gradient-based methods can lead tolocal minimum solutions, hindering the accuracy of simulation results. The other line ofresearch uses global optimization methods. The exemplary methods include genetic algo-rithms [20,30], simulated annealing [31], adaptive cluster covering [16], shufﬂed complexevolution [32], differential evolution [33], particle swarm optimization [34], and ant colonyoptimization [35]. While these methods are shown to be effective in ﬁnding the globalminimum of the objective function and improving the model accuracy, the signiﬁcantlyincreased numbers of numerical model evaluations compared with the gradient-basedmethod are the major concern. For a high-dimensional and long-term simulation, only asingle evaluation of numerical modeling would lead to a high computational workload.However, common optimization techniques are not tailored to ﬁt this characteristic andinclude multiple objective function evaluations, which lead to extremely expensive andeven prohibitive computation for the model calibration scenario.Over the past few decades, the surrogate model has been introduced to hydrologicalmodeling. The surrogate model has been widely used in the probabilistic approach forgroundwater model calibrations. The probabilistic approaches [36–41], e.g., the well-known MCMC-based DRAME algorithms [42,43], generally entail hundreds or thousandsof numerical model evaluations and would lead to prohibitive computational overhead.The surrogate model is an approximation to the computationally intensive numerical modelbut can be evaluated in a much more efﬁcient fashion. A series of data-driven surrogatemodels have been proposed, such as Bagging Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines [44],neural networks [45], Gaussian processes [46], kriging [47], radial basis functions [48],support vector machines [49], and genetic programming [50]. While these surrogatemodels solidly reduce the computational cost, the generation of a surrogate model thatwell ﬁts the numerical model still entails a large number of numerical model evaluations,and little effort has been paid to the tailoring of an efﬁcient optimization algorithm forsurrogate models.This paper proposes a novel model calibration method based on the Bayesian optimiza-tion (BO) method. The BO method is a global optimization method to optimize objectivefunctions that are time-consuming to estimate. The BO method has shown its success inparameter tuning in machine learning [51,52], materials design [53], and recommendersystems [54]. Compared with common optimization techniques that ﬁnd the minimumby extensively exploring the objective function, the BO method uses a surrogate model toapproximate the objective function and ensures computational efﬁciency. In terms of thesurrogate model, speciﬁcally, an acquisition function is devised for the minimization ofthe objective function and the avoidance of unnecessary objective function evaluations atcertain model parameter spaces. This allows us to ﬁnd the optimal objective function usinga very small number of numerical modeling evaluations. The proposed method is appliedto model the transport and retention of chromium in groundwater ﬂow systems. The",9.99,False,2,165.97500610351562,97.72831726074219,False,False,False,body

We use the Bayes’ rule to convertthe calibration criteria into the objective function, in which we measure the ﬁtness ofsimulated values to the observations and prior knowledge. To ﬁnd the calibrated modelparameters, the objective function is minimized by the BO method, in which the minimumof the objective function (i.e., optimized model parameters) is progressively searched in aniterated process. To reduce the expensive objective evaluations, the probabilistic surrogatemodel replaces the objective function in the BO method.

"To validate the efﬁciency of the BO method in model calibration, we compared itwith Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) [34], a well-known and effective model calibra-tion method in the hydrological ﬁeld due to its ﬂexibility, ease of implementation, andefﬁciency [66,67]. The PSO method is a stochastic, population-based, global optimizationtechnique inspired by swarm behavior observed in nature, such as ﬁsh and bird schooling.The number of particles is a signiﬁcant hyperparameter in PSO. Following the setting in [34],an excessive number of particles (=40) was used for the efﬁciency of highly-parameterizedmodel calibration. Here, an update of a particle’s position would lead to a numericalmodeling process. To compare the efﬁciency between the PSO and BO methods, we stopthe PSO iteration when the minimum of the objective function is close to or smaller thanthe minimum found by the BO method. Figure 13 illustrates the variations in objectivefunction values during the PSO iterations and the BO iterations. It is noted that the PSOmethod took overall 1520 objective function evaluations (1109 min versus 146 min resultingfrom the BO method) to gain an objective function value (1.70) close to the minimum (1.31)of objective function found by the BO method, which is much more than 200 evaluations inthe BO method. Figure 14 illustrates the model calibration performance of the PSO methodafter 200 objective function evaluations, which is the same number of objective functionevaluations as that of the BO method.

"While the BO method attains promising performance in the hypothetical cases, wefurther verify its effectiveness and reliability in a real case. These real data come fromchromium slag sites in Hunan Province, China. Here, the Cr(VI) concentrations measuredat 53 monitoring wells were set as the calibration targets. Since time series observations atthese 53 bores are withheld by the stakeholder at the site, only the observations obtainedseven months after the time the simulation starts are used for model calibration. The modelcalibration took 148 min. Figure 15 shows the variations of objective functions duringthe model calibration process, whereas Table 7 lists the values of objective functions atthe iterations when a better solution is found. Analogous to the results in Figure 8, thevalues of the optimization function are minimized dramatically within two decades ofiterations, which took only 15 min in the experiment.

When the optimization reaches the minimum, the simulated concentration iswithin the 95% conﬁdence interval, which indicates the calibrated model is promising to ﬁtthe observations.We further conducted the ablation study and the robustness study to verify the effec-tiveness and adaptivity of the BO. In the ablation study, we removed the observations at23 monitoring wells in the north and only left the observations at 20 monitoring wells inthe south as calibration targets. Figure 17 shows the model calibration performance.

"In the robustness study, similarly to the hypothetical case, we added different levels ofGaussian noise to the observations. Overall, four standard deviations were used to generatethe Gaussian noise. As shown in Figure 18, while the simulation errors are elevated dueto the increase in Gaussian noises, it can be seen that the BO method is less sensitive tonoises added to observations. Even though the noise added to the observations increasesto 0.5, the MAE of model calibration remains approximately 0.03. This reﬂects that theBO method is robust enough to handle observation errors and possibly other zero-meansystem errors in real-ﬁeld applications. The observations errors can essentially affect thevalues of the objective function. In the BO method, the objective function is approximatedby a surrogate model that explicitly considers noise-corrupted objective functions. Thus,it is reasonable that the model calibration results are robust to the noise of the objectivefunction in practice.The BO method is further compared with the PSO method in the real case. Here,the setting of the PSO method is the same as that used in the hypothetical case. The PSOtook 1720 object function evaluations (1255.6 min) to converge to an objective functionvalue of 1.21 (Figure 19), the same order of magnitude as the objective function value (1.58)obtained by the BO method. When the number of numerical models is 200, the BO methodevidently outperforms the PSO method (Figure 20). Combining the comparison resultsin both the hypothetic case and the real case, it is demonstrated that the BO method isevidently efﬁcient in model calibration. In contrast to the stochastic PSO method, which isunaware of the structure of the objective function [68], the BO method uses the surrogatemodel to explicitly approximate the objective function and adopts an acquisition functionto systematically search for the minimum objective function.

"In this paper, we propose a BO method for the calibration of 3D numerical models ofgroundwater ﬂow and contaminant transport. A Bayes model is built to fully representcalibration criteria and derive the objective function for model calibration. In contrast tothe use of common optimization approaches for model calibration, the computationallyexpensive objective function is approximated by a computationally efﬁcient probabilisticsurrogate model in BO. An effective acquisition function is adopted to search for themost promising model parameters that facilitate minimizing the objective function whileexploring the highly uncertain region of the objective function. This enables ﬁnding theoptimized model parameters effectively and efﬁciently by minimizing the objective functionwith a small number of objective function evaluations.Two case studies of model calibration for Cr(VI) transport simulation, which involvethe hypothetical case and the real case, demonstrate that, as the BO process proceeds, the BOmethod is effective in identifying hypothetical model parameters, minimizing the objectivefunction, and adapting different calibration criteria. The promising performance of theBO method is achieved within 200 objective function evaluations, which took 111 min asreported on an ordinary PC. Compared with the PSO model calibration method, the BOmethod shows superior efﬁciency in both the hypothetical and real case.In the future, we will further validate the performance of the BO method in morechallenging scenarios and expand its applicability and ﬂexibility.

"BO method motivates the use of high-resolution numerical models for long-term and high-ﬁdelity simulation. Due to the evidently lower number of objective function evaluationsin BO, the high-resolution numerical simulations that were originally computationallyprohibitive in the model calibration can now be allowed in applications. Another avenueis to scale the BO method to numerical models with hundreds of model parameters. Thiswould allow us to comprehensively consider the spatial heterogeneity of model parametersin the numerical models. These potential improvements can further enforce the ﬁtnessof observations and result in more convincing numerical models for the simulation ofcontaminant transport in the groundwater ﬂow system.",9.99,False,22,165.97500610351562,97.72831726074219,False,False,False,body
