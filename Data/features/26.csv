"ABSTRACT: Particulate matter (PM) air pollution is a majorhealth hazard. The health effects of PM are closely linked toparticle size, which governs its deposition in (and penetrationthrough) the respiratory tract. In recent years, low-cost sensorsthat report particle concentrations for multiple-sized fractions(PM1.0, PM2.5, PM10) have proliferated in everyday use andscientific research. However, knowledge of how well these sensorsperform across the full range of reported particle size fractions islimited. Unfortunately, erroneous particle size data can lead tospurious conclusions about exposure, misguided interventions, andineffectual policy decisions. We assessed the linearity, bias, andprecision of three low-cost sensor models, as a function of PM sizefraction, in an urban setting. Contrary to manufacturers’ claims,sensors are only accurate for the smallest size fraction (PM1). The PM1.0−2.5 and PM2.5−10 size fractions had large bias, noise, anduncertainty. These results demonstrate that low-cost aerosol sensors (1) cannot discriminate particle size accurately and (2) onlyreport linear and precise measures of aerosol concentration in the accumulation mode size range (i.e., between 0.1 and 1 μm). Werecommend that crowdsourced air quality monitoring networks stop reporting coarse (PM2.5−10) mode and PM10 massconcentrations from these sensors.KEYWORDS: Air pollution, aerosols, field validation, particle sizing, light scattering, PMS5003, SPS30■INTRODUCTION",9.5,False,1,51.477081298828125,239.04098510742188,False,False,False,body
"Airborne particulate matter (PM) is a major public healthconcern. Exposure to PM contributes to over a millionpremature deaths worldwide, and populations subject to long-term exposure suffer from significantly higher cardiovascularand respiratory morbidity.1−3 The atmospheric fate andtransport of PM is largely determined by particle size (dp, inμm), as is the penetration and deposition of PM within thehuman respiratory tract.4 How particle size relates to PMhealth effects remains an active area of research; humanexposure to size modes such as ultrafine (dp < 0.1 μm), fine (dp< 2.5 μm), and coarse (2.5 < dp < 10 μm) PM have each beenassociated with adverse health outcomes.5,6 Traditional(reference) methods for measuring size-resolved particleconcentrations are expensive (e.g., instrument costs from$10,000 to $100,000 each) and resource intensive,7 limitingtheir use to spatially sparse outdoor monitoring networks inhigh-income countries and research studies with shortsampling durations and small samples sizes.The emergence of low-cost PM sensors (miniaturized, mass-produced devices that cost ∼$15 to $50 each) has facilitatedthe deployment of cheaper (∼$250/each) monitors incrowdsourced measurement networks (e.g., PurpleAir, Clarity)that are denser than traditional national/regional-scale net-",9.36,False,1,51.477081298828125,490.5870056152344,False,False,False,body
"works.8 These networks are being leveraged to supportgrowing interest in PM exposure and health science globally.Most low-cost PM sensors operate on the principle of aerosollight scattering: a fan draws PM into a small housing, the PMpasses through a focused beam of light, and a photodetectormeasures the intensity of the light scattered by the particles.8",9.41,False,1,315.43902587890625,470.1210021972656,False,False,False,body
"Most low-cost PM sensors report mass and numberconcentrations across a range of sizes (e.g., PM0.3−0.5PM0.5−1.0, PM1.0−2.5 PM2.5, PM10). By including concentrationsacross multiple-sized bins as sensor outputs, manufacturersspecify, either explicitly or implicitly, that their sensors canclassify particles by size. However, manufacturer documenta-tion often omits the working principle of the sensor (i.e.,whether it functions as an optical particle counter or anephelometer) and the bias/precision of size-resolved outputs.Particle sizing is challenging even for reference-gradeinstruments, especially those that rely only on light scattering.9",8.55,False,1,315.4389953613281,542.2909545898438,False,False,False,body

"Low-Cost Sensors. We evaluated three light-scatteringsensor models (two units of each model) with prices and formfactors that would be appropriate for use in large networksand/or personal exposure monitors (i.e., sensors that cost <$100 and weigh < 50 g): the PMS5003 (Plantower, Beijing,China), the SPS30 (Sensirion, Stäfa, Switzerland), and the IPS-7100 (Piera Systems, Mississauga, Canada).

All sensors were new and operated according tomanufacturer recommendations (without additional calibra-tion).A GRIMM EDM 180 (GRIMM Aerosol Technik, Ainring,Germany) was chosen as the reference monitor due to itsability to measure PM in 31 particle size channels (0.25−32μm). For quality assurance, we compared PM2.5 and PM10measurements between the GRIMM EDM 180 and acolocated Beta Attenuation Monitor (5014i, Thermo Scien-tific, Waltham, MA, USA) (Figure S6).

"Marked differences were evident in the low-cost sensors’responses to PM of different size fractions (Figures 1 and 2).The low-cost sensors measured PM1.0 with relatively low bias(mean absolute error [MAE] ranging from 1.2 to 2.4 μg/m3;Table 1) and strong linear correlation (R2 from 0.83 to 0.93).For PM2.5, the sensors showed slightly worse agreement withthe reference monitor. MAE increased by a factor of 2 for allsensors (3.0 to 3.9 μg/m3), and linear correlation decreased(0.65 ≤R2 ≤0.76 compared to 0.83 ≤R2 ≤0.93, as statedabove). A larger disparity was evident for PM10 concentrationsreported between the low-cost sensors and reference monitor(R2 from 0.07 to 0.23). Consistently low PM10 concentrationsreported by the low-cost sensors, relative to the referencemonitor, indicated that larger particles (i.e., dp > 1.0 μm) werenot adequately detected by the sensor models we evaluated.Differential mass concentrations provided further evidence ofthis limitation. The PM1.0−2.5 and PM2.5−10 signals were noisyand nearly uncorrelated with the reference measurementthroughout the experiment. Some of these patterns (or lackthereof) were clearly identifiable from a simple visualassessment of the time series plots (Figure 1). The readingsfrom all sensors lost accuracy when going from PM1 to PM2.5and more so when going from PM2.5 to PM10. In those sameplots, the PM2.5−10 signals from the low-cost sensors remainedflat and nearly zero throughout the campaigns, despite thereference monitor reporting PM2.5−10 concentrations of ∼10−50 μg/m3.

"close to the 1:1 line indicating good agreement with thereference monitor, and all the sensors fit the linear modelreasonably well (R2 ≥0.83; see also Figures S8, S9).Additionally, the relatively small scatter in the PM1.0 regressionplots and the narrow band patterns in the REU plots (FigureS3) denote low noise.

Thistranslates to more scattering, larger errors, and poorer fit of thelinear models (0.65 ≤R2 ≤0.76), but depending on theapplication, a calibrated sensor could produce usable PM2.5estimates, as has been reported previously.21−23 For instance,to evaluate PM2.5 data quality, the uncertainty could beanalyzed as the European Commission recommends, whichspecifies a 50% REU upper bound as the data quality objective(DQO) for low-cost sensors.24 Alternatively, PM2.5 could beestimated from the more accurate PM1.0 output by developingad hoc conversion equations for a combination of sensor modeland use case.On the other hand, the PM10 signals of these sensors areclearly flawed, incorporating the noise of PM1.0−2.5 and thesystematic bias of PM2.5−10.

Sensor calibration should also occurin the presence of air pollution sources that are similar incomposition and magnitude to those that the sensors willexperience during deployment. Regardless of the calibrationscheme, fundamental safeguards for the use of sensors shouldinclude protocols that address data handling and initialprocessing, outlier detection and removal, sensor detectionlimit, and data completeness. Further, calibration schemesshould disclose the kind of reference air quality monitor used,the duration of the colocation experiment and ambientconditions, the time-averaging intervals used for processingthe data, and the statistical model(s) selected with appropriatejustification (e.g., evidence of model assumptions beingmet).20,29",9.41,False,5,315.4389953613281,264.7229919433594,False,False,False,body
"In summary, we conclude that low-cost PM sensorscommonly used in crowdsourced measurement networks arebest described as accumulation mode PM (PM0.1−1.0) sensorswith little-to-no sizing ability or measurement reliabilityoutside this size range. None of the devices evaluated herecould detect coarse mode PM (PM2.5−10), and most struggledto measure the 1.0−2.5 μm range when compared to a size-resolved reference monitor. Therefore, PM2.5 estimates fromthese low-cost sensors should be interpreted with caution, andPM10 estimates from these sensors should be seen only as aproxy representing the contribution of the accumulation modeto the PM10 fraction.■ASSOCIATED CONTENT*sı Supporting InformationThe Supporting Information is available free of charge athttps://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.3c00030.",9.77,False,5,315.4389953613281,533.1639404296875,False,False,False,body
