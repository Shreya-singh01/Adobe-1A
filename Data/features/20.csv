"Abstract: The cryogenic cooling of infrared (IR) photon detectors optimized for the mid- (MWIR,3–5 µm) and long wavelength (LWIR, 8–14 µm) range is required to reach high performance. This isa major obstacle for more extensive use of IR technology. Focal plane arrays (FPAs) based on thermaldetectors are presently used in staring thermal imagers operating at room temperature. However,their performance is modest; thermal detectors exhibit slow response, and the multispectral detectionis difﬁcult to reach. Initial efforts to develop high operating temperature (HOT) photodetectors werefocused on HgCdTe photoconductors and photoelectromagnetic detectors. The technological effortshave been lately directed on advanced heterojunction photovoltaic HgCdTe detectors. This paperpresents the several approaches to increase the photon-detectors room-temperature performance.Various kinds of materials are considered: HgCdTe, type-II AIIIBV superlattices, two-dimensionalmaterials and colloidal quantum dots.",8.79,True,1,166.91502380371094,278.9434509277344,False,False,False,body

"HgCdTe takes the dominant position in infrared (IR) detector technology. This mate-rial has triggered the rapid development of the three “detector generations” considered formilitary and civilian applications and brieﬂy described in the caption of Figure 1. IR detec-tor technology combined with fabrication of epitaxial heterostructure [by molecular beamepitaxy (MBE) and metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD)] and photolitho-graphic processes revolutionized the semiconductor industry, thus enabling the design andfabrication of complex focal plane arrays (FPAs). Further their development will relate toimplementation of fourth generation staring systems, which the main features are to be:high resolution (pixels > 108), multi-band detection, three-dimensional readout integrationcircuits (3D ROIC), and other integration functions such as polarization/phase sensitivity,better radiation/pixel coupling or avalanche multiplication. The ﬁrst three generationsof imaging systems primarily rely on planar FPAs. Several approaches to circumventthese limitations, including bonding the detectors to ﬂexible or curved molds, have beenproposed [1]. Evolution of fourth generation is inspired by the most famous visual systems,which are the biological eyes. Solution based on the Petzval-matched curvature allows thereduction of ﬁeld curvature aberration. In addition, it combines such advantages as simpli-ﬁed lens system, electronic eye systems and wide ﬁeld-of-view (FOV) [2,3]. The colloidalquantum dot (CQD) [4] and 2D layered material [5] photodetectors fabricated on ﬂexiblesubstrates exhibit the potential to circumvent technical challenges in the development ofthe fourth generation IR systems.",9.88,False,1,166.8459930419922,511.56036376953125,False,False,False,body

"The need for cooling considerably limits more widespread use of IR technology. Thereare signiﬁcant attempts to decrease system size, weight, and power consumption (SWaP)to limit IR system’s cost and to increase the operating temperature. The invention ofmicrobolometer array was a milestone step in development of IR cameras operating at300 K. However, microbolometers belong to the class of thermal detectors with limitedresponse time—typically in millisecond range and could not be used in the multibandapplications. To omit this limitation, further efforts are directed to increase operatingtemperature of photon detectors.Initial efforts in development of the high operating temperatures (HOT) photodetec-tors were focused on HgCdTe photoconductors and photoelectromagnetic detectors [6].Many concepts have been implemented and tested to improve the performance of IRphotodetectors operating at near 300 K and compiled in References [7–10]. In addition tophotoresistors and photodiodes, three other types of IR detectors can operate at near 300 K:magnetic concentration detectors, photoelectromagnetic (or PEM) detectors and Dembereffect detectors.

Among different bulkmaterials, the narrow gap semiconductors are more suitable for the HOT photodetectorsthan competitive technologies, such as extrinsic devices, Schottky barrier photodiodes,quantum dot infrared photodetectors (QDIP) and quantum well infrared photodetectors(QWIP) [16]. The high performance of intrinsic photodetectors results from high density ofstates in the conduction and valence bands (contributing to high IR absorption), and longcarrier lifetime (contributing to low thermal generation).The goal of IR detector technology is the fabrication of HOT photodetector character-ized by the dark current lower than the background ﬂux current and 1/f noise negligiblylower than to the background ﬂux shot noise [17,18].In several papers, it was shown that the detector size, d, and F-number (f/#) are themain IR systems parameters [19,20].

"The SRH generation-recombination mechanism determines the carrier lifetimes inboth lightly doped n- and p-type HgCdTe in which SRH centres are related to residualimpurities and native defects. Kinch et al. in 2005 [23] published that the experimentalcarrier lifetimes for n-type LWIR HgCdTe range from 2 up to 20 µs at 77 K irrespective ofdoping <1015 cm−3. The MWIR carrier lifetime are substantially longer assuming 2 up to60 µs. However, several papers published in the last decade have shown τSRH signiﬁcantlyhigher in low temperature range and low doping concentrations, above 200 µs up toeven 50 ms versus cut-off wavelength [20] see Table 1. The range of low doping that canbe reproducibly obtained in Teledyne Technologies HgCdTe epilayers grown by MBEis ~1013 cm−3. Gravrand et al.

Thosevalues are lower than the earlier assessed by US research groups [25]. However, theywere estimated for devices with higher doping level in absorber >1014 cm−3.

As presented, each cell consists oflightly p-type doped absorber and N+/P+ wide-bandgap highly doped contact layers. Theheterojunction contacts collect the photogenerated carriers absorbed in every active layer.However, practical problem is related to the resistance of the adjacent N+ and P+ layers.In the last decade, several designs of the multi-stage IR devices have been developed.They are based on III-V semiconductors and might be now divided into two classes:mentioned earlier interband (IB) ambipolar QCIPs and intersubband (IS) unipolar QCIPs.The ﬁrst study on IS QCIPs began about two decades ago [11] as the photodetectors weredeveloped from the quantum cascade lasers (QCLs). However, currently IB QCIPs showthe higher performance in comparison with IS QCIPs due to the relativity much longercarrier lifetime.

The diffusion length restriction in traditionalthick absorber detectors is bypassed by using the discrete absorber design imposingrecombination of the photogenerated carriers in the next stage within short transportdistance. The single thin absorbers are connected in series and the total thickness of theactive layer can be even thicker than the absorption depth. The photocurrent is determinedby carriers generated in the single absorber (one stage) and is independent of the numberof stages meaning that the photons absorbed in following stages do not increase the netphotocurrent but only provide the current continuity through the device.

"The IB QCIPs (with T2SLs absorbers) MBE growth process is challenging where manyinterfaces and strained thin layers are deposited in structures. Nevertheless, the signiﬁcantprogress has been reached for T2SL based detectors particularly for the LWIR and HOTconditions. They exhibit the capabilities of the IB optical transitions with the exceptionalcarrier transport properties of the QCIP architectures.Currently, IB QCIPs has two types of conﬁguration: current-matched (designed tohave an equal photocurrent in every single stage) and non-current-matched [39]. Hinkeyand Yang described the IB QCIP structure with equal absorbers offering the potential forsigniﬁcant responsivity improvement assuming αL ≤0.2 (αL—Product of the absorptioncoefﬁcient and the diffusion length) [40]. From a technological point of view, the non-current-matched IB QCIPs (identical absorber thickness in all stages) are simpler to designand grow in comparison to the current-matched ones. The disadvantage of non-current-matched structure is the limited responsivity due to the signiﬁcant light suppression alongthe detector’s structure. The high electrical gain, lately observed at HOT conditions in thesestructures, could at least partially compensate in terms of responsivity reduction [41,42].Despite the development of other technologies, HgCdTe is still the most broadly usedadjustable gap semiconductor for IR detectors, to include uncooled operation, and standsas a reference for alternative technologies. Figure 10 demonstrates that T2SL InAs/GaSbIB QCIPs bipolar devices (dashed lines) are proper candidate for HOT conditions.

Although thetechnology readiness, the 2D materials are still at low level of development, the detectors’manufacturability and reproducibility have been challenging (this topic is widely studiedin research laboratories around the globe).Nicolosi et al.

"and electronic properties. A high absorption coefﬁcient of TMDs (typically 104–106 cm−1)results from dipole transitions between localized d-states and excitonic coupling of suchtransitions. Thanks to that, >95% of the sunlight is absorbed in sub-micrometer thicknessTMD ﬁlms, while carrier mobility is low (typically less than 250 cm2/Vs). Despite thefact that the mobility can be improved by increasing the number of TMDs layers, thisdisadvantage is difﬁcult to circumvent. The carrier density depends on the doping levelsand the number of recombination centers, and typically reaches 1012 cm−2 [54].In comparison to graphene, TMDs, like molybdenum disulﬁde (MoS2), tungstendisulﬁde (WS2) and molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2) is characterized by higher absorptionin the visible and NIR ranges. As presented in Figure 13, the 2D bandgap proﬁle isso different what allows to cover a very broad range from the UV to IR. For currentstatus of technology, only graphene-based, black phosphorus-arsenic (bPAs), noble metaldichalcogenides, and bismuthene (like Bi2Te3 and Bi2Se3) are treated as a main player in IRand also THz regions. Since 2D TMDs are limited to UV-NIR, bP can be adjusted to below0.3 eV by As doping. Due to high mobility, up to 3000 cm2/Vs, bP is a proper candidate forhigh sensitivity and fast speed photodetection.

"The lead chalcogenides CQDs (primarily PbS) are the materials for SWIR photodetec-tors with detection to 2 µm. The peak can be adjusted using smaller dots by adding NIRbands to hyperspectral visible image sensors or using larger dots to include the InGaAsspectrum of image sensors [75]. From a performance standpoint, SWIR photodetectorsbased on PbS CQDs have reached detectivity, D* comparable to commercial InGaAs photo-diodes, with a values of >1012 Jones at 300 K. HgTe CQDs have opened the MWIR spectralrange. Detectivity, D* between 1010 to 109 Jones at 5-µm was demonstrated for HgTe CQDdevices while maintaining a fast response time at thermoelectric cooling temperatures. Itis unlikely that CQD IR detectors will ever reach the performance of currently popularInGaAs, HgCdTe, InSb and T2SL photodiodes.Recent demonstrations of low-cost SWIR and MWIR CQD imaging arrays have height-ened the interest in these devices. For both PbS and HgTe CQD photodetectors integrationin camera imaging have been demonstrated [76]. It is expected that the successful im-plementation of this new class of IR technology may match the broad impact of cheapCMOS cameras that are widely used today. First SWIR cameras built on CQD thin ﬁlmphotodiodes fabricated monolithically on silicon ROICs have been launched [77,78]. TheAcuros camera has resolution 1920 × 1080 (2.1 megapixels, 15-µm pixel pitch) and uses0.4 to 1.7 µm broadband spectral response [77]. The IMEC’s prototype imager has resolu-tion of 758 × 512 and 5 µm pixel pitch. The CQD photodiodes on silicon substrate reach anexternal QE above 60% at 940 nm wavelength, and above 20% at 1450 nm, allowing un-cooled operation with dark current comparable to commercial InGaAs photodetectors [78].At present, CQD cameras are used in newer applications that require high-deﬁnitionlow cost imaging on smaller pixels without extreme sensitivity. It can be predicted thatincreasing the dot size while maintaining a good mono-dispersion, carrier transport and QEwill improve maintaining low noise levels. Due to continuous development of depositionand synthesis techniques, much higher performance will be reached in the future.",9.8,False,22,166.8459930419922,405.0687561035156,False,False,False,body

"HgTe CQD photodiodes. The gathered experimental data are also included. The estimateddetectivity, D* for CQD photodiodes are located below those for HgCdTe photodiodes. Asis shown, at temperature above 200 K the theoretically predicted detectivity for HgCdTephotodiodes is limited by background. Rule 07 coincides well with theoretically predictedcurve for Auger-suppressed p-on-n HgCdTe photodiode with doping concentration inactive region 1015 cm−3. As is marked in Section 3.3, at present stage of HgCdTe technologythe doping concentration is almost two orders of magnitude lower (mid 1013 cm−3).All experimental data gathered in Figures 12 and 20 indicates on sub-BLIP photode-tectors performance. Both ﬁgures also clearly show that the detectivity values of CQDphotodetectors are inferior in comparison with HgCdTe photodiodes and are generallyworse also in comparison with 2D material photodetectors. Moreover, the theoreticalpredictions indicate on possible further HgCdTe devices performance improvement afterdecreasing of i-doping level in P-i-N photodiodes. For doping level of 5 × 1013 cm−3 thephotodiode performance can be limited by background radiation in spectral band above3 µm.

"Discovery of graphene in 2004 gave a new impetus on technology developmentand investigations of 2D layered materials where their uncommon electronic and opticalproperties make them promising candidates for IR photodetectors. Despite spectaculardemonstration of high detectivity like this achieved for black phosphorus layered pho-todetectors in MWIR spectral range [46] and noble TMD photodetectors like PdSe2/MoS2heterojunction with record detectivity in LWIR range at room temperature [47], manychallenges remain to be introduced to exploit the distinct advantages of these new mate-rials. The prospect of commercialization of 2D material photodetectors depends on theirlarge-scale integration with existing photonic and electronic platforms like CMOS tech-nologies, high operability, spatial uniformity temporal stability, and affordability. Industryfabrication of devices is in the early stage of development and manufacturability.In general, pristine narrow gap 2D materials are characterized by weak optical ab-sorption and short carrier lifetime. Various ingenious approaches (electron trap layers,photogating effect with the graphene fast transfer channel) enhance sensitivity, however onthe other side, degrade the electronic performance including carrier mobility. In this wayhigh 2D material photodetector sensitivity collides with slow response time what seriouslylimits their practical applications.In spite of sixty years development history of HgCdTe, it ultimate HOT performancelimit has not been achieved. In order to achieve this goal, the doping concentration below5 × 1013 cm−3 is required. This level of doping concentration has been recently achievedin fully-depleted HgCdTe FPAs by Teledyne Technologies.At present stage of HgCdTe technology, the semiempirical rule Rule 07 (speciﬁed in2007), widely popular in IR community as a reference for other technologies, was foundnot to fulﬁl primary expectations. In this paper, it was shown that the potential propertiesof HOT HgCdTe photodiodes operating above 3 µm guarantees achieving more than orderof magnitude higher detectivity (above 1010 Jones) in comparison with value predicted byRule 07, and this detectivity is limited by background. In this context it is rather difﬁcult tocompete 2D material and CQD photodetectors with HgCdTe photodiodes.",9.7,False,24,166.96600341796875,98.23436737060547,False,False,False,body
