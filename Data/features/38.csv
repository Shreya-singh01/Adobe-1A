"Infrared radiation receivers are used in many up-to-datefields of science and technology determining current levelof technological progress. The most important fields oftheir applications are industrial automation, robotics, spacetechnology, medicine, and military technology.Three various types of detectors (both thermal and pho-ton ones) are employed in these receivers. The noise pro-duced in detectors and systems of signal conversion con-strained detection of low intensity signals (Fig. 1). Theworks on IR detection are aimed at reduction of detectorand preamplifier noise to the value lower than the photonnoise one [1,2].",10.0,False,1,51.932098388671875,330.0542907714844,False,False,False,body

With the higher factor M,both the signal and the noise increase. There is exactly de-termined value of the avalanche multiplication factor M forwhich the distance between a straight line representing asignal and a curve representing the total noise is the longestone. It corresponds to the case when S/N has its maximumvalue. For the given photodiode and temperature, the valueof bias voltage is exactly determined, for which S/N has itsmaximum [29].These analyses have been verified experimentally andspecial supply module has been designed (Fig. 5). Thismodule ensures APD operation with maximum value ofS/N ratio in wide range of temperature changes and it wasapplied in a receiver for laser rangefinder with a source ofeye-safe radiation.The investigation results show that for high value ofS/N in the receivers with photovoltaic detectors the follow-ing activities should be done:•minimisation of the noise from background, detector,bias circuit and preamplifier,•lowering temperature of detector operation,•selection of optimal working point of APD by usinglow-noise supply modules.",10.06,False,3,304.49090576171875,155.50172424316406,False,False,False,body

"and stabilisation of avalanche multiplication factor of APD.It allows us to detect laser pulses of duration 100 ns andpower below 10 nW [30].The other device is a multispectral IR pyrometer usedfor remote temperature measurements [31,32]. The multi-mband pyrometer was developed for non-contact tempera-ture measurement of the objects with unknown and wave-length-dependent emissivity. The pyrometer was designedusing single thermoelectrically cooled PbS detector ofspectral band of 1–2.5 m and 8 narrow-band filters. Tem-perature measurements are possible of the objects at tem-perature within the range of 500C–1200C and frequency75 Hz. It can be used for controlling various industrial--technological processes as well as in research works fortesting typical singleband pyrometers and temperaturemeasurement of the objects the emissivity of which de-pends on wavelength and time.In order to have maximum value of S/N ratio the fol-lowing activities have been performed:•selection of optimal current supplying PbS detector,",10.04,False,5,304.4920959472656,319.9295349121094,False,False,False,body

"PC detectors) optimised for the spectral range of3–4.2 µm.Data acquisition, preliminary processing and visualisa-tion is performed by PC with graphic card and PCL-816Data Acquisition Card (Advantech). Special software wor-king on the Windows 95/98 platform and using AdvantechDLL libraries was designed.In some receivers with pyroelectric detectors popcornnoise is produced. Such noise at the output of a detectionsystem is received as a signal from short existing thermalobject, which can be a source of false alarm. Figure 12shows the block diagram of the microprocessor circuit forthe detector [33,34]. There are nine main blocks: pre-amplifier, filter, A/D converter, digital signal processor,D/A converter, low frequency filter, data memory, and pro-gram memory. Signal form the preamplifier and low passfilter is converted into a 16 bit A/D converter. In the digitalsignal processor circuit (DSP), a spectrum of the signal iscompared with mathematical model of the popcorn noise.If the popcorn noise is produced, its spectrum is removedby the digital filter in the DSP. Then, inverse fast Fouriertransform was applied to the signal. So, we can remove aspectrum of the popcorn noise.

"Also low-noise preamplifiers for various types of IR de-tectors were elaborated. The obtained parameters are pre-sented in Table 1.An idea of synchronic receiving was applied in optoel-ectronic base sensor (Fig. 13). The sensor contains a trans-mitter (system of control logic and laser controller) and aphotoreceiver (input stage of the photoreceiver, detector ofa peak value, comparator, and counter). The detector ofa peak value is used to define maximal received pulse.A loop connecting control system with the receiver counterchecks compatibility of the received pulses with the pulsesfrom a control generator.
