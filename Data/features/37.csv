"Abstract: Performance of systems for optical detection depends on the choice of the right detectorfor the right application. Designers of optical systems for ranging applications can choose from avariety of highly sensitive photodetectors, of which the two most prominent ones are linear modeavalanche photodiodes (LM-APDs or APDs) and Geiger-mode APDs or single-photon avalanchediodes (SPADs). Both achieve high responsivity and fast optical response, while maintaining lownoise characteristics, which is crucial in low-light applications such as ﬂuorescence lifetime measure-ments or high intensity measurements, for example, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), in outdoorscenarios. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of detectors is used as an analytical, scenario-dependenttool to simplify detector choice for optical system designers depending on technologically achievablephotodiode parameters. In this article, analytical methods are used to obtain a universal SNR com-parison of APDs and SPADs for the ﬁrst time. Different signal and ambient light power levels areevaluated. The low noise characteristic of a typical SPAD leads to high SNR in scenarios with overalllow signal power, but high background illumination can saturate the detector. LM-APDs achievehigher SNR in systems with higher signal and noise power but compromise signals with low powerbecause of the noise characteristic of the diode and its readout electronics. Besides pure differentia-tion of signal levels without time information, ranging performance in LiDAR with time-dependentsignals is discussed for a reference distance of 100 m. This evaluation should support LiDAR systemdesigners in choosing a matching photodiode and allows for further discussion regarding futuretechnological development and multi pixel detector designs in a common framework.",8.98,True,1,166.9150390625,315.1203918457031,False,False,False,H2
