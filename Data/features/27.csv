"1 Introduction The rapid industrialization and urbanization process has greatly improved our life level, while also bringing seri-ous air pollution, such as inhalable particulate matter (PM10) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5). The air pollution caused by PM2.5/PM10 not only greatly harm to human health, but also seriously hinders economic development [1-3]. Faced with the severe environmental pollution and governance needs, PM2.5/PM10 daily monitoring have been carried out in many countries, e.g., in China, not only a huge monitoring network been established, but also systematic technical regulations for measurement methods or monitors have been completed [4,5]. Currently, four kinds of PM2.5/PM10 measurement methods are available [6-11], i.e., tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM), Beta gauge, gravimetric method, and light scattering. The gravimetric method is based on filter membrane weighing, which can make mass concentration of particulate matter trace to SI unit, therefore, it has already been considered as a reference method for PM2.5/PM10 [7]. However, to make electronic balance employed in method can output accurate results, it is necessary to load enough particulate matter on the filter membrane, so it is actually a time-consumed method and cannot output real-time results. As continuous automatic methods for PM2.5 and PM10, TEOM method and Beta gauge method can output measurement results per less than 1hour with high accuracy and sensitivity [7], but both methods are relatively expensive and impactors with nominal 50% cut-points of 2.5μm and 10μm are required to obtain aerosol samples meet the definition according to aerodynamic principle. Compared with the above methods, light scattering method for PM2.5/PM10 has the advantages of low-cost, outputting real-time results with interval of seconds-level, etc. By using monitors or sensors based on this low-cost",9.91,True,1,49.61822509765625,541.8859252929688,False,False,True,H1
