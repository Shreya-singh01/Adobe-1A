However, in light scattering measurement technology, due to significant effect of particle characteristics (density, refractive index, shape factor, particle size distribution, etc.) and instrument characteristics (scattering angle, scattering solid angle, etc.), measurement results by light scattering method are unsatisfactory in many cases [12-21]. For effectively improve the accuracy and reliability of PM2.5/PM10 monitor based on this method, in this paper, a PM2.5/PM10 monitor based on the single particle light scattering was developed, where, the sensor’s structure was optimized to ensure well-correspondence between output signal and particle size, sensor’s particle size channels and count efficiency were calibrated to make the output signal (particle number concentration, PN) in each channel more reliable, the empirical values of parameters, i.e., heating temperature, particle density, involved in the developed dy-namic heating system and PN-PM algorithm, were achieved.",9.99,False,2,49.6199951171875,65.24592590332031,False,False,False,body

For the aerosol sample composed of spherical particles with the same density and size, if PN is known, then its mass concentration can be calculated by equation 3, i.e., mass concentration (C) of the sample is directly proportional to the number of particles per unit volume (𝑁/𝑉ሻ, particle density (𝜌ሻ, and particle size (D) which could be calculated from equation 2. Therefore, as long as the relationship between D and u, particles number per unit volume and the particle density can be measured or accurately obtained, the particle mass concentration in each particle size channel can be calculated. And then, by accumulate the mass concentrations of each channel in less than 2.5μm or 10μm, PM2.5 and PM10 could finally be obtained.   2.1.2. Development of PM2.5/PM10 monitors The schematic diagram of designed PM2.5/PM10 monitor is shown in Fig. 3, where sampling module, optical module (sensor based on light scattering), circuit module and software module are mainly involved. Sampling module should pump aerosol samples into the optical module of the monitor at a constant flow rate and minimize humidity interference on light scattering signals as much as possible. In view of this, a Dynamic Heating System (DAS) with 1m effective heating length was first designed. By continuously heating the pumped aerosol sample, the moisture attached on particles could be removed, thereby ensuring the reliability of particle sizing derived from light scattering flux. In DAS there mainly are humidity sensor for ambient aerosol, sampling inner tube with heating resistance wire wrapped externally and temperature sensor, temperature & humidity dynamic control circuit, and temperature insula-tion layer with outer-shell, etc. Base on the obtained humidity results obtained by the in-build sensor, on-off of heating resistance wire, temperature inside the sampling inner tube could be controlled automatically. Here, the heating func-tion will not be activated in humidity less than 30%, while when humidity is in 30% -88%, and larger than 88%, the heating temperature are set at 40 °C and 60 °C separately. A gas pump (Thomas G3/04) was used as the drawing source to let the aerosol sample into the monitor at nominal flow volume of 1L/min. More than that, a flow monitoring unit is built in flow circuit, by using it and PID algorithm, constant flow output of the gas pump can be achieved.",10.55,True,3,49.61993408203125,408.09869384765625,False,False,False,body
"Fig.3 Schematic diagram of the structure of PM2.5/PM10 monitor  As the key component of monitor and for achieving accurate results of PM2.5/PM10 concentration, optical mod-ule (sensor) should be of the measurement capability with upper limit not less than 10μm. Although the number concentration of particulate matter in the atmospheric air tends to increase with the decrease of particle size, particles less than 0.3μm have an ignored influence on PM2.5/PM10. So, considering of R&D costs, the particle size lower limit for monitor as low as 0.3μm is sufficient. Based on the simulation results described in 2.1 section, a kind of single particle light scattering sensors (SPLSS) with (0.3~10) μm measurement capability was designed as shown in Fig. 4 (a), where, point C, O, and F are the vertices, curvature centers, and focal points of the spherical mirror, respectively, and point G is the particle position, also known as the photosensitive zone position. This sensor is mainly composed of a laser source (with 650nm wavelength, 10mW power), collimating lens (with outer diameter Φ 6mm, radius of curvature R 4.15mm, focal length f 8mm), cylindrical lens (with radius of curvature R 10mm, focal length f 20mm), spherical mirror (with outer diameter Φ 25 mm, focal length f 10mm, radius of curvature R 20 mm), photodetector (with 6mm×6mm photosensitive area and 0.38 AꞏW-1 photoelectric conversion efficiency), aerosol inlet/outlet and light trap, etc. The distances of the vertices of the spherical mirror to the center of the photosensitive region and to the photodiode are 11.6 mm and 34.4mm.

Therefore, in this paper, a circuit module based on threshold comparison was developed to divide sensor’s particle size channels into 16 channels, which are 0.3μm, 0.4μm, 0.5μm, 0.6μm, 0.7μm, 0.8μm, 0.9μm, 1μm, 1.5μm, 2μm, 2.5μm, 3μm, 4μm, 5μm, 7μm and 10μm. Meanwhile, for observing the original pulse signal from photodetector and further calibrating voltage corresponding to particle size, a BNC interface for outputting original signal is reserved. For the software module, there are three parts according to its function, MCU main program, flow monitoring & adjustment program, and data collection & processing program. And among them, data collection & processing program can process data according to the PN-PM algorithm, simultaneously output and store PN concentration of each particle size channel, PM2.5/PM10 results. PN-PM algorithm mentioned here is a calculate method to obtain the corresponding mass concentration from the PN concentration in each channel. For light scattering sensors, D in equation 3 should be the equivalent particle size of the channel. Due to light scattering is more sensitive to particle’s volume and surface area, the particle size base on volume surface area (𝐷ଷଶ), can be obtained by equation 4, is selected as the equivalent particle size of the channel.",10.76,True,5,48.632381439208984,245.3659210205078,False,False,False,body

Generally, by using high resolution online and in situ measurement techniques, effective density of particles could be measured [22].

By directly compared with reference particle counter (TSI9306), which have already been calibrated with condensation particle counter, particle counting efficiency in each channel of the sensor could finally be obtained. All calibrated results were exhibited in Fig. 10, where, within (0.3-10) μm range the particle counting efficiency of the sensor is in 93%~106%, error bars represent the calibration expanded uncertainty (k=2). Then those calibrated results were written into the software system of the monitor for correcting the particle counting value (N).",10.78,True,10,48.632747650146484,249.6259307861328,False,False,False,body

"3.2 Performance verification of monitor To verify the reliability of monitor for measuring PM2.5 and PM10 in real environment, comparative tests were conducted with PM2.5/PM10 samplers based on filter membrane weighing method in Chaoyang District, Beijing from April to May 2022. In this comparison period, the daily average of PM2.5 and PM10 were in range of (5-130) μgꞏm-3 and (50-500) μgꞏm-3. In comparison, for PM2.5/PM10 samplers, sampling flow volumes are controlled within ± 3% of nominal flow volume (16.7Lꞏmin-1). Fiberglass filter membranes was used to deposit atmospheric particulate matter. Before and after sampling, the blank and particle-deposited membranes were balanced for 24 hours in a constant Temperature & Humidity chamber, where T&H were controlled within (20 ± 0.2) ℃ and (50 ± 2) %RH, to eliminate the impact of moisture. And in the same T &H situation, masses of those membranes were weighted by using balance with resolution of 1μg. Finally, according to the mass difference of membrane deposited with particles after 24-hour-sampling and blank membrane and the sampling volume in standard condition, the PM2.5 or PM10 concentration could be calculated as standard values. For the monitor, the PM2.5 or PM10 average values within 24 hours can be obtained by software. In this way, 15 pairs of PM2.5 valid data pairs, and 16 pairs PM10 valid data pairs were obtained.",9.75,True,10,49.61822509765625,604.3463134765625,False,False,True,body
"Fitting through linear regression of those data pairs, both PM2.5/PM10 results of developed monitor have good consistency with the filter membrane weighing method, as shown in Fig. 11. The parameters, i.e., slopes, intercepts, and correlation coefficients, in linear regression equation of PM2.5 and PM10 results, meet the technical requirements of of Chinese standard (HJ653-2021), where, the specification of PM10 and PM2.5 continuous automatic monitoring system including light scattering method are proposed.",9.79,False,11,49.618804931640625,65.24592590332031,False,False,False,body

"(b) Fig.11 Comparison results of PM2.5 (a) and PM10 (b) of monitor  4 Conclusion Low-cost PM2.5 and PM10 monitoring instruments based on single particle light scattering was developed, which could measure PM2.5 and PM10 in atmospheric air accurately. In this research, for precisely identifying the particle size, establish the quantitative relationship between the light scattering flux and the particle size is essential. While the simulation results show that in the condition of scattering angle and the scattering solid angle are 90 ° and 60 ° respectively, within several specific particle size ranges the voltage signal of the photodetector has a good linear rela-tionship with the square of the particle size. Based on this optimization result, the monitor’s particle size range was divided into 16 channels using a threshold voltage comparison circuit. The calibration results indicate that the thresh-old voltage is linearly proportional to the square of particle size (D2) within different particle size ranges, which is consistent with expectations. For calibration and correction of the counting efficiency and particle size channel of SPLSS or monitor, a cali-bration device was developed, where, by using atomizer connected with differential mobility classifier and dust gen-erator, monodisperse aerosol samples with peak value in (0.3~10) μm could be obtained. The simulation and experi-mental results indicate that the uniformity of particulate matter in the calibration chamber was fan blade length and rotate speed depend, and when the rotate speed was 100rꞏmin-1 and the length of the fan blade was 20cm, the uni-formity of the working section was better than 3.3%. In the PN-PM algorithm, density is an important factor affecting the accuracy of calculated PM2.5 and PM10 results. Although diversity of particle sources in aerosols, there is a certain correlation between particle composition and particle size. Therefore, the particle composition varies among different particle size segments, i.e., the density of particles within different particle size segments can be obtained from the density of their dominant particles.

"on this consideration and referring to relevant research conclusions, in this paper, density values of particulate matter were set 1.60 gꞏcm-3, 1.90 gꞏcm-3, 2.10 gꞏcm-3, and 2.26 gꞏcm-3 within the range of of (0.3-1.0) μm, (1.0-2.0) μm, (2.0-5.0) μm and (5.0-10.0) μm. The feasibility of this kind of density-assignment method was verified through comparison with standard instruments. Certainly, due to the time limitations of the comparative experiment, the assigned density values in this paper still have the possibility of optimization.",10.26,False,12,49.61883544921875,65.24592590332031,False,False,False,body
