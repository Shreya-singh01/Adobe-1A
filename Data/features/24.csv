"Herein, we aim to evaluate the photodetector performance of various nanostructured materials (thinﬁlms, 2-D nanolayers, 1-D nanowires, and 0-D quantum dots) in ultraviolet (UV), visible, and infrared (IR)regions. Speciﬁcally, semiconductor-based metal oxides such as ZnO, Ga2O3, SnO2, TiO2, and WO3 are themajority preferred materials for UV photodetection due to their broad band gap, stability, and relativelysimple fabrication processes. Whereas, the graphene-based hetero- and nano-structured composites areconsidered as prominent visible light active photodetectors. Interestingly, graphene exhibits broad bandspectral absorption and ultra-high mobility, which derives graphene as a suitable candidate for visibledetector. Further, due to the very low absorption rate of graphene (2%), various materials have beenintegrated with graphene (rGO-CZS, PQD-rGO, N-SLG, and GO doped PbI2). In the case of IR photode-tectors, quantum dot IR detectors prevails signiﬁcant advantage over the quantum well IR detectors dueto the 0-D quantum conﬁnement and ability to absorb the light with any polarization. In such a way, wediscussed the most recent developments on IR detectors using InAs and PbS quantum dot nano-structures. Overall, this review gives clear view on the development of suitable device architecture underprominent nanostructures to tune the photodetector performance from UV to IR spectral regions forwide-band photodetectors.© 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

"been leading to strengthening of nanoelectronics technology(Khomutov et al., 2003). Speciﬁcally, various novel composite ma-terials have been replaced traditional materials due to their drasticeffect on our environment and poor device performance. In thisviewpoint, researchers have been adopted various experimentaltechniques to constitute the novel materials under essentialnanoscale structures, including nanowires, quantum dots, nano-belts, and thin ﬁlms (Wang et al., 2020a; Ponraj et al., 2016). Forthis, strategic of fabrication methods including magnetron sput-tering, electron beam evaporation, chemical vapor deposition(CVD),electrochemicalandmechanicalexfoliation,chemicaletching, pulsed laser deposition (PLD), and spray pyrolysis havebeen paid great attention due to the potential high surface to vol-ume ratio and stability with fewer defects (Zeng et al., 2012; Xiaet al., 1999; Liu et al., 2005).Because of the enriched physical and chemical properties, thenanostructures have emerged as attractive materials in the ﬁeld ofnanoelectronics, energy, optoelectronics, photocatalysis, sensors,drug delivery, biomedicine, lasers, and ﬂexible technology (Wang,2007; Laurenti et al., 2019; Cheng et al., 2017). In this era ofmodernization, most of the electronic devices directly or indirectlyassociated with the light interaction in various applications. Forexample, many diseases have been treated under powerful lightexposures (lasers). In this point of view, photodetectors (PDs) haveattracted considerable attention, which can effectively detect andmeasure the incident light. Speciﬁcally, photodetector technologypractically applied in (i) ultra-violet (UV) region for ozone sensing,pollution detection, gas sensors, and ﬂame detection, (ii) visible(Vis) region for energy, ﬁberoptic communications, video imaging,and artiﬁcial vision, and (iii) infrared (IR) region for bio-medicalimaging, defence, space telescopes, and meteorology.It is well-known that wide range of materials has been used forthe PDs application including metal oxides, transition metal halidesand perovskites. It is to be highlighted that if the composite ma-terials integrated with different nanostructures, the sensitivity ofthe device can be greatly improved. Therefore, it is necessary todevelop and explore the suitability of selective material forimproved photodetector performance. In recent years, nanosheetsof WO3 PD are sensitive to UV light (365 nm) with responsivity of293 A/W (Liu et al., 2015). On the other hand, WO3 nanowiresshowed sensitive to visible light (404 nm) and produced theresponsivity about 19 A/W (Wang et al., 2020b). Therefore, thereliability of PDs performance depends on key aspects, whichincluding band gap, crystallinity, and particle size. In addition, thinﬁlm PDs have also been developed under good responsivity, whichcan be easily scalable for mass production. However, their responsetime is lagging due to the poor charge carrier mobility. Moreover,ﬂexible PDs technology is emerging in smart phones, wearabletechnology, smart watches, and electronic tattoos. For this, ultra-thin materials are necessary with high efﬁciency (De Fazio et al.,2016). Typically, nanostructured materials are favored for thedevelopment of photodetector technology due to their attractiveelectronicproperties,photosensitivity,highchargecarriermobility, and ﬂexible nature (Zhang et al., 2020). Therefore, variousPDs based on vivid nanostructures (nanowires, nanorods, andquantum dots) have been developed as IR photodetectors toenhance the response speed and as well as to achieve superiorﬁgure of merits. Hence, this review summarizes the accomplish-ments of current PDs technology based on different nanostructuresand also provides constructive discussion and challenges faced.Based on the above spectral detectivity, photodetectors havebeen classiﬁed into three major categories (UV, Vis, and IR photo-detectors) (Zhai et al., 2009).

"1.1.1. Photoconductive effectPhotoconduction process is one of the important features todevelop the high-performance photoconductors. Generally, thestructure of photoconductor contains two metal-electrode contactsat both ends of the semiconductor, which establishes the ohmic-contact between semiconductor and metal-electrode. Thus, thisdevice architecture illustrates the advantage of photoconductionmechanism by absorbing the incident light. As a result, electron-hole pair generation and separation can be effectively facilitatedunder electrons transfer from semiconductor to one end of elec-trode and holes to another end of electrode. However, superiorphotocurrent generation and separation of charge carriers aredirectly proportional to the applied potential. Moreover, photo-current generation also depend on the charge carrier mobility andlifetime of the developed semiconductor. It should be noted thatthe photoconduction mechanism is predominantly seen in metal-semiconductor-metal (M-S-M) structured PDs. The M-S-M PDsconsists of a simple planar structure with interdigited electrodes,which can be easily integrated with other components in the op-toelectronic circuits.

In the ﬁrst concept of mechanism, photogenerated elec-trons or holes can be trapped at the surface adsorbents or by thedefect levels. While the other kind of photogenerated charge car-riers (electrons or holes) circulates multiple times within the deviceand generate photocurrent in the circuit. In another kind ofmechanism, charge carriers generate on the surface of adsorbents.Also, one kind of charge carriers diffuses into the material andcontributes to current generation.

"Photodetection in UV region draws undivided extension due toits ability in diverse applications: (i) ﬂame and radiation detectionto take preventive measures, (ii) astronomical studies and securedspace communications, (iii) environmental and biological studies,(iv) chemical analysis for screening, and (v) optical communica-tions (vi) missile plume detection etc. In particular, typical UV ra-diation categorized into four main spectral regions such as UV-A(400nme320nm),UV-B(320nme280nm),UV-C(280 nme200 nm), and far UV (200 nme10 nm) (Ren et al.,2013). It should be highlighted that UV light (˂ 280 nm) cannotpenetrate into the earth’s atmosphere. Interestingly, previousstudies show that most of the UV light reaching the atmospherefalls under UV-A category. Thus, detection of UV-A radiationdetection become prominent (Reddy et al., 2019a,b; Yamada et al.,2019; Yadav et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019; Yadav et al., 2021).Over a period of time wide range of materials such as perovskites,silicon derivatives, metal halides, transition metal dichalcogenides,and metal oxides have been developed to detect the UV light (Liet al., 2020; Shi et al., 2016; Ahmadi et al., 2017; Mu et al., 2017;Tian et al., 2015). Speciﬁcally, Si, SiC, diamond-based, nitride-based,transitional metal oxides, and metal di-chalcogens used to detectthe UV radiation (Konstantatos et al., 2010, 2012). For better UVphotodetection and extensive period, photomultiplier tubes wereutilized under compact size.Nowadays, signiﬁcant research is focusing on the fabrication ofportable and highly sensitive UV detectors due to its rapid usage inmicroelectronic devices. Owing to the signiﬁcant capability of UVabsorption, several silicon-based materials have been extensivelyused in various ﬁelds. However, silicon exhibits a bandgap of 1.1 eV,which make it to absorb visible radiation. To avoid that, severallayers of high-pass optical ﬁlters have been strategically intro-duced, which suggests the expensive device fabrication process.Particularly, insertion of ﬁlters possesses relatively high noisegeneration (Chen et al., 2020a). Therefore, transition metal oxides,SiC, and AlGaN alloys especially attractive for UV photodetectionunder its chemically and thermally stable nature. Interestingly,bandgap of above all materials falls under UV light, suggesting thatwe can avoid the usage of high-pass optical ﬁlters (Chen et al.,2020a). In another direction, metal oxide-based semiconductorssuch as ZnO, SnO2, Ga2O3, WO3, and TiO2 established as an excellentUV photoactive material in optoelectronic devices. The above wideband gap metal oxide materials establish outstanding processingapproaches such as ease fabrication, scalability, control over crystalorientations, uniformity, and reproducibility in the UV photode-tector community. In such a way, all of the above featuresdemonstrate that metal oxide semiconductors (ZnO, SnO2, Ga2O3,WO3, and TiO2) can be widely used in highly sensitive UVphotodetectors.",7.98,False,4,37.5848388671875,221.78652954101562,False,False,False,body

"Among various metal oxide semiconductors, ZnO has beenextensively studied and used in various applications (Khan et al.,2020; Saric et al., 2019; Shiau et al., 2020; Chauhan et al., 2020;Rabani et al., 2021). In particular, ZnO exhibit a wide bandgap(~3.2 eV) and n-type semiconductor behavior with exciton bindingenergy of ~60 meV (Pearton et al., 2003). Considering the widebandgap, ZnO importance signiﬁcantly aided for the improved UVabsorption. Note that engineering of ZnO UV photodetectors alsoinvolves superior charge carrier generation (electron-hole pair) andseparation. Driven by the above-mentioned constructive features,we here attempted to explore various device fabrication techniquesto reveal superior UV photodetector performance. In this section,M-S-M structured Pd and Ti doped ZnO ﬁlms have been demon-strated for better understanding the possibility of Schottky andohmiccontactsformationforsuperiorUVphotodetectorperformance.The role of thermal evaporation and sol-gel deposition tech-niques has been highlighted to achieve superior UV photodetectorproperties of ZnO thin ﬁlms under Schottky junction formation (Aliand Chakrabarti, 2012) In this study, a key factor for superior UVphotodetector performanceofZnO thinﬁlms compared byconsidering the deposition techniques. The sol-gel derived ZnOthin ﬁlm photodetectors exhibited superior responsivity (0.17 A/W)and EQE (62%) compared to the thermal evaporated ZnO (respon-sivity of 0.08 A/W and EQE of 23%). It is to be highlighted that sol-gel technique is a feasible route to realize the adsorption anddesorption of H2O and oxygen. Thus, sol-gel derived ZnO thin ﬁlmshave prevailed superior photodetector properties compared to thethermal evaporated samples.Chemical bath deposition (CBD) method also guided to developstable ZnO ﬁlms. After that, UV photoconductive behavior of ZnOﬁlms (at 70 C) studied under the precise M-S-M structure forma-tion (Shaikh et al., 2016). Speciﬁcally, the ZnO deposition time canbe modulated to improve the UV photodetector performance. Here,Ag metal used as electrode material. In this regard, the fabricatedAg/ZnO/Ag (M-S-M structure) device architecture exhibited supe-rior photocurrent generation (113.83 mA) and responsivity (28.14 A/W) under UV light intensity (l ¼ 365 nm) of 1.8 mW/cm2 at appliedbias of 5 V. Moreover, as the dependence of CBD technique on ZnOthin ﬁlm deposition, the photodetector stability and reversibilitycan be signiﬁcantly improved with a rise time of 9 s and a fall timeof 21 s. On the other hand, enhanced photoresponse attributed tothe improved crystalline nature of ZnO ﬁlms (as deposited for 7 h)and interconnected wire structured morphology. At higher depo-sition time, ZnO ﬁlms peeled off easily. Considering the CBD tech-nique and deposition time, it mean that superior charge carrier(electrons) transportation effectively observed at the metal-semiconductor interface.Sol-gel technique is also beneﬁcial for the fabrication of ZnO-based M-S-M Schottky barrier UV photodetectors (Ali et al.,2014). In this work, the photoresponse of pure ZnO, Pd dopedZnO, and Pd microplate embedded ZnO ﬁlms have been compared,while Pd used as a Schottky-contact. Here, barrier-height andsaturation current density of M-S-M photodiode were extractedusing logarithmic reverse current dependence. The Pd metalmicroplates incorporated with ultra-thin ZnO ﬁlms showed higherresponsivity (0.33 A/W) and EQE (115%) under UV illumination(360 nm).

"ﬁlms. The above results suggested that Pd microplate embeddedZnO exhibit superior UV photodetector under depletion regionformation at the interface of microplates and semiconductorinterface.In another direction, simple spray pyrolysis technique wasadopted to improve the UV photodetector performance of ZnO thinﬁlms under Ag metal as an electrode (Inamdar et al., 2014). Underforward and reverse bias conditions, IeV characteristics conﬁrmedthe ohmic-contact formation of between Ag metal and ZnO. Itshould be noted that UV photodetector performance of ZnO wascompletely under visible-blind. As a result, ZnO exhibited highestresponsivity of ~788 A/W under 375 nm of UV illumination. Overall,superior photocurrent and photoresponse properties of ZnO mainlydue to the highly crystalline nature of ZnO and intrinsic donordefects (oxygen vacancies and Zn interstitials). Such behavior alsoobserved by the ZnO thin ﬁlms developed by the CBD method(Shaikh et al., 2016).In addition to the pure ZnO (Inamdar et al., 2014), researchersfurther focused on development of transition metal doped ZnO (Ti-doped ZnO) thin ﬁlms by spray pyrolysis technique to investigatethe UV detection properties (Shewale et al., 2015). Here, photode-tector performance of pure and Ti-doped ZnO ﬁlms systematicallystudied under Sn as a metal electrode contact, which developed theM-S-M structural conﬁguration on both ZnO and Ti-doped ZnOsamples. Accordingly, linear IeV characteristics of this M-S-Mstructure under forward and reverse bias conﬁrmed the ohmiccontacts between the metal (Sn) layers and semiconductor (Ti-doped ZnO). At selective bias voltage of 5 V, superior photocurrentgeneration of 112.68 mA was observed for the Ti-doped ZnO underUV illumination (l ¼ 365 nm), which is higher than dark state(6.10 nA). At the same time, the responsivity was about 0.051 A/Wunder the light intensity of 2 mW/cm2. In conclusion, it has beenfound that Ti metal doping signiﬁcantly improved the charge car-rier density in the ZnO, which yielded superior UV photodetectorperformance.Low-cost solution processed method has been established todevelop the ZnO nanowires for studying the UV photodetectorperformance (Ates et al., 2012). Single-walled carbon nanotubes(SWNT) layer was used as electrode onto the ZnO nanowires.Fig. 2(a) presents the schematic representation of SWNT thin ﬁlms/ZnO nanowire photodetector. Here, various experimental studiesconducted to reveal the relation between photodetector perfor-mance and nanowire density. These studies suggest that photo-currents were signiﬁcantly improved by increasing the nanowiredensity and maximum photocurrent shown was 520 mA under365 nm of UV light. As a result, SWNT thin ﬁlms/ZnO nanowirephotodetector exhibited lower recovery time about 16 s (Fig. 2(b)),which is ascribed to the improved charge carriers. Unlike the otherZnO thin ﬁlm photodetectors, transparent ZnO nanowires devel-oped on ﬂexible substrates exhibited stable UV photodetectorperformance even under different radii of curvature.Among the above discussed ZnO based PDs, spray depositedZnO thin ﬁlm PDs (M-S-M structure) achieved superior respon-sivity about 788 A/W upon 375 nm UV illumination, compared toother ZnO based PDs. It was mainly due to the negligible darkcurrents under intrinsic donor defects, oxygen vacancies, andinterstitial Zn. On the other hand, ZnO NWs were exhibited supe-rior photocurrent about 520 mA under UV illumination of 365 nmwavelengths and comparable responsivity of 0.15 A/W than otherZnO PDs.

"Apart from the ZnO, SnO2 also found its importance in UV PDsapplication and it behaves like a transparent metal oxide semi-conductor. It is generally agreed that SnO2 exhibits chemically andthermally stable nature at atmospheric conditions (Wang et al.,2018). On the other hand, SnO2 is highly transparent to thevisible spectrum and reﬂects most of the IR radiation. Thus, SnO2 issuitable for transparent heat reﬂective surfaces (Pandey et al.,2020). Due to its transparent nature, SnO2 was vastly used inLCDs,LEDs,plasmadisplaypanels,andﬂattouchpanels(Ramarajan et al., 2020). Apart from the above optoelectronic de-vices, SnO2 also investigated in photocatalytic activity and active-anode material in Li-ion batteries (Zhang and Wang, 2020). Inthis section, we systematically discussed the development of SnO2-based composites for enhancing the stability and overall UVphotodetector performance.Recently, SnO2 nanowire networks have successfully synthe-sized using CVD technique, which followed the vapor-liquid-solidmechanism (de Araujo et al., 2020). Here, M-S-M based structurewas demonstrated neither by expensive photolithography nor in aclean room atmosphere.

Upon UV illumination, SnO2 observed with supe-rior photodetector performance with rise time (tr) of 0.37 s and falltime (tf) of 0.59 s at 5 V bias voltage. It has been found that rise timeand fall time increased in the case of sun light (tr ¼ 0.61 s andtf ¼ 0.55 s) and white light (tr ¼ 71.6 s and tf ¼ 131.5 s) conditions.Apart from this, high sensitivity (>104) was obtained under UV",7.73,False,5,306.59417724609375,396.6846923828125,False,False,False,body

It concluded thatSnO2 prevailed superior UV photodetector performance.Similarly, vertically aligned SnO2 NWs were successfully syn-thesized by glancing angle deposition (GLAD) method (Chetri et al.,2020). In this investigation, effect of annealing temperature (350 C,550 C, 650 C, 750 C, and 900 C) on structural, optical, andelectrical properties of SnO2 NWs systematically studied. In such away, the device fabricated at selective annealing temperature of650 C achieved improved crystalline nature. Therefore, SnO2 NWsannealed at 650 C achieved superior photodetector performancewith maximum responsivity of 2.58 A/W and photodetectivity of64.13  1010 Jones at l ¼ 300 nm of irradiance than other annealingtemperatures. In a word, crystalline nature boosted the capacity ofdefect controlling, which results to the increase of charge carriers.In addition to the above pure SnO2 NWs (de Araujo et al., 2020;Chetri et al., 2020), SnO2-based heterojunction (ZnO/SnO2) core-shell nano-rod arrays (CSNAs) developed using facile hydrother-mal and chemical liquid deposition techniques (Fu et al., 2020).They highlighted the importance of localized excitons for recoveryof near-band-edge transition. Therefore, Iphoto/Idark ratio of ZnO/SnO2 ensured 7.2  104 at 1 V, which was ~270 times higher thanpure ZnO. Further, with the introduction of localized states in theZnO/SnO2, ZnO/SnO2 enhanced the photoresponse by means ofresponsivity (28.5 A/W) and speciﬁc detectivity (2.9  1014 Jones). Itis also improved in mitigating the response time of ZnO/SnO2 (8.7 s)compared to ZnO (45.0 s). On the other hand, recovery time of ZnO/SnO2 (20.8 s) also decreased compared to ZnO (56.6 s) undernanocrystalline SnO2 shell-layer development on ZnO.In another direction, superior photodetector performance wasachieved by developing the ﬂexible hollow-sphere SnO2 photode-tector using water-oil interfacial assembling technique onto thepolyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate (Tian et al., 2013).

The band to bandcharge carrier transition between the SnO2 hollow spheres is pre-sented in Fig. 3(b). The device performance was investigated bothin vacuum and ambient atmosphere.

Moreover, the SnO2 hallow sphere ﬁlm deviceexhibits high sensitivity, stability and improved signal-to-noiseratio (SNR) about 300 times under the illumination of UV light ofwavelength 320 nm at 45 mW/cm2 intensity.

It is to be highlighted that constructiveinterfacial interaction between ZnO and SnO2 resulted improvedphoton absorption and photocurrent generation.

In this study, higher ox-ygenvacancieshavebeendevelopedathigherdepositiontemperatures, which resulted in improved responsivity, widerdetection range, and longer photo-decay time. Speciﬁcally, a-Ga2O3developed at selective deposition temperature of 500 C exhibitedsuperior photoresponsivity about 138 A/W compared to othertemperatures of RT (1.46 A/W), 200 C (16 A/W), 300 C (25 A/W),and 400 C (71 A/W). Overall, deposition temperature played a keyrole to improve the UV photodetector performance of a-Ga2O3.In addition to the a-Ga2O3 (Zhu et al., 2020b), highly-crystallizedsingle b-Ga2O3 micro/nano-sheets were also studied to achievesuperior UV photodetector performance under Schottky barrierformation (Zhong et al., 2015). Interestingly, b-Ga2O3 showed sig-niﬁcant rectifying property under asymmetric contact formation atan open circuit voltage of 0.33 V and UV wavelength of 254 nm. Insuch a way, b-Ga2O3 achieved remarkable photodetector perfor-mance such as sensitivity (dark current of ~10 nA), Rl (19.31 A/W),EQE (9427%), fast response time (about 20 ms), excellent stabilityand reversibility.

Inter-estingly, Mg:GaOx ﬁlm highlighted with decrement in the trappingcenters for achieving the improved photo-generated charge car-riers. Speciﬁcally, Mg:GaOx-based SBUV PD exhibited suppresseddarkcurrents(48pA),higherlight-to-darkcurrentratio(~338 at 3 V bias voltage), and faster response (a decay time of0.15 s) time. Thus, Mg-divalent ion dopant plays a key role in GaOxto achieve the lower dark-current and quick response time.Thin ﬁlms of poly-Ga2O3 was developed using sputtering tech-nique on c-plane sapphire substrate followed by the thermalannealing at 800 C, 900 C, 1000 C, and 1100 C (Hu et al., 2020).Later, Ti and Ni metal electrodes were developed on poly-Ga2O3thin ﬁlms.

In particular, Ga2O3 thin ﬁlms annealed at1100 C temperature showed less responsivity and photocurrentthan the as deposited samples.

Thus, it has been used as dazzle-free mirrors inautomobiles, variable reﬂection mirrors, and smart windows (Buchet al., 2016).

In addition to this, ohmic-contact between thephotoactive material and electrode as shown in also assisted inenhancing the photocurrent. Fig. 5(a) shows the inkjet printed WO3thin ﬁlm developed onto the SiO2 substrate based UV photode-tectors and Fig. 5(b) exhibits the evidence of ohmic-contact be-tween the electrode and photo-active material (Cook et al., 2018).Even though, both ink jet printed WO3 thin ﬁlms and ALD syn-thesized mono-layer of WO3 consists of ohmic-contact, the mono-layer of WO3 was exhibited the higher responsivity of 71.6 A/Wthan inkjet-printed WO3 thin ﬁlm (2.70 A/W). It was due to theefﬁcient charge transfer by 2-D structured WO3 device.Implying a similar device concept, monolayer structured WO3demonstrated for revealing the photodetector performance in UV-A region with strategic functional capabilities (Hai et al., 2017b). It isimportant to note that the precise role of monolayer structuredWO3 achieved ultrafast photoresponse time (<40 ms) and photo-responsivity (~0.329 A/W).

Speciﬁcally, monolayer structure certainly possessesquantum-conﬁned effects and new functional opportunities topower the various optoelectronic devices. Because the monolayerWO3 processes new path for the fabrication of highly ﬂexible,inexpensive, and extremely sensitive photodetectors, it is reason-able to expect these types of UV photodetectors in industrializationand commercialization.The popular M-S-M device structure is successfully synthesizedby stacking the WO3 nanospheres and WO3 thin ﬁlms on sapphiresubstrates (Lee et al., 2018).

It is particularly important to prove and understandthe UV photodetector performance. We brieﬂy note that TiO2 is atransitional metal oxide, comes with a bandgap of (3.2 eV) andexhibits rutile, anatase, and brookite crystalline forms ( Zhao et al.,2007). However, one must consider the chemical inertness, highphotocatalytic activity, strong oxidizing power, endurance, non-toxicity, and low fabrication cost of TiO2 (Hitosugi et al., 2010;Bera et al., 2018). Thus, TiO2 also inspired by the excellent structuraltransformation and non-stoichiometric phase transitions, whichsafeguarded its importance in optoelectronic sensors and displaysystems.

These widely distributed defects acted as therecombination centers, which were eventually resulted in thedecrement of response time (rise time of 6 s and decay time of 15 s).Overall, all the above features (reduced recombination, defecttrapping and lower response time) attributed to the improvedcrystalline nature of the TiO2 nanocrystals.Similar M-S-M device structure also studied on RF magnetronsputtered TiO2 thin ﬁlms (Caliskan et al., 2013).

"and high electric ﬁeld between the electrodes signiﬁcantly inﬂu-enced the exponential growth of dark current. As a result, M-S-Mbased photodetector helpful for the achieving the very low darkcurrents about 1.57 nA/cm2 at 5 V. The results show that the TiO2M-S-M photodetector at speciﬁc bias voltage of 50 V and wave-length of 300 nm achieved the responsivity of 1.73 A/W. Also, theresponse time of the photodetector was measured under the riseand fall time of 7 s and 3 s, respectively. It can be attributed to theincreased trap density existing in the as-deposited ﬁlms andlimited space between metal contacts and photo-active material.To further study the importance of M-S-M structure, epitaxialTiO2 thin ﬁlms were deposited on LaAlO3 single crystal substratesby RF sputtering technique (Xing et al., 2011). Here, Ag metalcontacts were developed on the epitaxial TiO2 layers and Ag/TiO2/Ag UV PD test device has been fabricated. Accordingly, the M-S-Mbased TiO2 photodetector exhibited the superior responsivity of3.63 A/W at a UV wavelength of 310 nm. In order to achieve theohmic-contact behavior in M-S-M photodetector, it is necessary touse the high work function Ag metal as electrode. Because ofohmic-contact behavior, M-S-M structure proved reduced darkcurrents about 0.14 nA at a bias voltage of 10 V.Implying a similar concept, high-quality TiO2 epilayers weredeveloped on the lattice-matched LaAlO3 substrates at 500 C usingpulsed laser deposition technique (Zhang et al., 2015). A prototypeof M-S-M based Au/TiO2/Au UV-photodetector device was fabri-cated using Au as Schottky-contact. Here, the as-deposited TiO2thin ﬁlm exhibited excellent visible-blind UV characteristics withan optical bandgap of 3.25 eV, signifying its potential in UVdetection. As a result, this M-S-M based TiO2 UV-photodetectordevice architecture had been proven as a high UV to visible rejec-tion ratio of 105 under low dark-currents (0.25 pA at 5 V) and highresponsivity (0.21 A/W) upon UV illumination of wavelength270 nm. Such a low dark current value reveals the Schottky junc-tion formation at the interface of metal/semiconductor.Unlike the pure TiO2, another TiO2/Ag/TiO2 tri-layered structurefabricated using GLAD technique to realize the self-poweredphotodetector under dissimilar top electrodes (Ferhati et al.,2020).

"achieved.Accordingly,thedeviceresponsivitysigniﬁcantlyimproved by 80% with extremely low dark-currents (~50 pA)compared to the traditional TiO2 UV-PDs (~20 mA). Bringingtogether, the optimized TiO2/Ag/TiO2 device exhibited outstandingUV responsivity of 0.2 A/W, detectivity of 5.3  1013 Jones and Ion/Ioff ratio of 137.2 dB, even under self-powered operating mode upon365 nm monochromatic UV light illumination.Considering the TiO2 based UV photodetectors, TiO2 nano-crystalline ﬁlms (Au/TiO2/Au) achieved remarkable responsivity(199 A/W) under the wavelength 260 nm of UV light. It was pri-marily due to the improved crystallinity and reduced Schottkybarrier height. However, TiO2 thin ﬁlm and TiO2 epilayer based PDsexhibited comparatively low responsivity of 3.63 A/W (310 nm) and0.21 A/W (270 nm), respectively. Besides, the TiO2 based materialsraised its importance as a UV-A sensitive nature and preferred forenvironmental applications.In the above sections, we have explored the strategic ap-proaches to fabricate the UV photodetectors using various metaloxide semiconductors (ZnO, Ga2O3, SnO2, TiO2, and WO3). Specif-ically, experimental conditions such as deposition time, metalcontacts and annealing temperature greatly devoted to achievingsuperiorUVphotodetectorperformance.Bycomparingtheannealing temperature, Ga2O3 ﬁlms annealed at 600 C achievedexcellent responsivity of 138 A/W compared to the SnO2 annealedat 500 C (2.58 A/W). Indeed, doping effect predominantly inﬂu-enced the dark current of Pd doped ZnO and Mg doped Ga2O3 ﬁlms.Especially, the ﬂexibility of UV nanostructure photodetectors(nanowires and nanospheres) appeared to reduce the dark cur-rents. But, the responsivity was low due to the increased recom-bination rate. However, the responsivity of the UV photodetectordrastically increased to 28.5 A/W by introducing the bi-layer ofZnO/SnO2. It was due to the formation of optimized heterojunctioninterface and smooth ﬂow of photogenerated charge carriers.Among all the metal oxides, WO3 ﬁlms deposited (CVD technique)achieved high responsivity (293 A/W) and Iphoto/Idark ratio (2000).Overall, taking the beneﬁts of optimized experimental conditions,appropriate doping element and developing of bi-layers signiﬁ-cantly inﬂuenced the photodetector performance of WO3.

"Despite the signiﬁcant advantage and importance of UV pho-todetectors based on wide band gap materials in ﬁeld of environ-mental monitoring, ﬂame detection and controlling, visible PDsalso have numerous applications in the contemporary world oftechnology in the following aspects: (i) collision detectors formonitoring hurdles in driver bling spot, detectors for controlling airbags opening timings in usage in automotive technology and (ii)also in ultra-fast imaging technology. With the emergence of visiblelight photodetectors, it is essential to understand the visible lightphotodetector mechanism and performance to reach the currenttechnological requirements. Primarily, previous reports on siliconand germanium based materials highly suitable for visible lightphotodetectorperformanceduetoitsnarrowbandgap(Konstantatos et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2017, 2018; Wang et al., 2014,2015; Flemban et al., 2017; Xue et al., 2011; Siontas et al., 2019). Itshould be noted that visible light photodetectors exhibit higherresponse time, poor sensitivity, high dark current and relatively lowEQE compared to UV photodetectors.Interestingly, great efforts have been devoted on lead dihalide(LDH) and transition metal dichalcogenides to achieve the superiorvisible light response (Velusamy et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2016a;Zhang et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2015; Ramasamy et al., 2016). It shouldbe noted that these materials are very susceptible to react with theenvironmental oxygen. However, PbI2 and PbFI show excellentresponse under vacuum conditions (Ismail et al., 2019; Wei et al.,2017; Wang et al., 2017). Very recently (Shkir et al., 2019), re-ported cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) and indium-doped CZT(InCZT) single crystals-based visible light photodetectors with highresponsivity. On the other hand, two-dimensional (2D) graphene(rich of carbon atoms) came into limelight. Thus, it has been used innumerous ﬁelds including solar cells, sensors, and optoelectronics.Indeed, graphene with packed carbon atoms exhibit superior me-chanical strength, high electron conductivity, broad range spectralabsorption, and ultra-high mobility (Falkovsky, 2008; Balandin,2011; Papageorgiou et al., 2017; Neto et al., 2009).

"Recently, cadmium zinc selenide nanostructures and rGO wereprepared separately and then mixed together as a solution in aTeﬂon beaker containing glass substrate. Then the CZS-rGO nano-composite thin ﬁlms were deposited on the substrate throughhydrothermal-assisted chemical bath deposition technique forrevealing the visible light photodetector performance (Mathewet al., 2020). Here, the authors investigated the photodetectorperformance under effective active area of 0.5 cm2, where silverpaste was used as an electrode material. In this study, the deviceperformance was signiﬁcantly increased under selective rGO con-centration of 2 wt%. The results showed that rGO-CZS achievedsuperior visible light responsivity (18.5 mA/W) and speciﬁcdetectivity (2.08  1012 Jones). Most importantly, the rGO sheetsincluded in this device contributed to superior charge carriermobility, which eventually reduced the transit time. In a word, rGO-CZS represent the strength of visible light responsivity under thecommunity of rGO sheets.Novel perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) developed on rGO (PQD/",8.01,False,10,37.58549499511719,557.9740600585938,False,False,False,body

Speciﬁcally, PQD/rGO structure describesthe advantage of negatively charged functional groups present onthe rGO surface for the diffusion of electron cloud, nucleation, andgrowth of PQDs on rGO. As a bilayer formation of PQD/rGO, desiredcharge transfer occurs from PQDs to rGO compared to the PQDs andrGO mixture as a thin ﬁlm using spin coating or drop-castingmethod. The precise development of PQD-rGO exhibited highresponsivity (1.07  103 A/W), detectivity (1  1013 Jones), andsharp switching in the visible region. Fig. 6(a) and (b) depict theschematic representation of GPQD-rGO photodetector and energyband alignment, which reveals the charge transfer from GPQD andrGO. Fig. 6(c) illustrates the transient photoresponse of GPQD-RGOsuperstructure under light illumination (442 nm) with On and Offconditions for one cycle. From the spectrum, fast photoresponsewas observed with quick rise time (0.3 s) and fall time (0.3 s). As thePQDs normally grown on rGO, low responsivity was achieved dueto the poor charge transfer at the interface. Therefore, the directgrowth of PQDs on the rGO sheets could be adopted for develop-ment of stable visible light active 2-D photodetectors like transitionmetal halides and metal dichalcogenides.Recently, investigation on gallium nitride (GaN) and nitrogen-doped single-layer graphene (N-SLG) heterostructures endeav-oredtorevealthevisiblephotodetectorperformance(Sankaranarayanan et al., 2020). In this work, the GaN epilayer wasdeposited on N-SLG substrates using CVD technique. They selectedAu as a metal contact, which associated for developing the M-S-Mstructured photodetector. Experimental results, further suggestthat the M-S-M structure formation prevailed superior responsivityanddetectivityintherangeof150e400A/Wand1.08  1012e2.89  1012 Jones, respectively. Conﬁrming the supe-rior visible light response, the M-S-M structure further observedwith the rising time and fall time of 10 ms and 25 ms, respectively.Overall, the GaN epilayer deposited on N-SLG substrate were highlyprompt to the visible light with an improved charge carriermobility and charge carrier generation.Usually graphene oxide (GO) provides superior charge carriermobility for further development in the visible light photodetectorperformance. In such a way, graphene oxide doped lead iodide (GO-PbI2) studied for achieving the visible light photodetection perfor-mance under 532 nm (Sharma et al., 2020). In this study, PbI2nanorods/GO heterostructure was synthesized via microwave-assisted synthesis route. As the inﬂuence of GO doping, thephotodetector performances of GO-PbI2 such as Rl, EQE, and D*were signiﬁcantly increased (0.182 A/W, 42%, and 1.79  1011 Jones)compared to the pure PbI2 (0.060 A/W, 14%, and 6.38  1010 Jones).It is to be highlighted that the GO-PbI2 mainly provides the trapcenters at the interface, which ﬁlled under visible light illumina-tion. It can be attributed to the superior charge carrier mobility ofGO in the GO-PbI2.On the other hand, metallic (1T) conﬁguration WSe2 fromtransition metal dichalcogenides family also exhibited highly efﬁ-cient visible photodetector performance with the integration ofrGO (He et al., 2020). The nanostructures were systematicallysynthesized using modiﬁed-hydrothermal process.

In such a way, the time taken for lightresponse of rising and decay were 0.001 s and 0.002 s respectively.Thus, the rapid raising and decay of photocurrents of rGO/WSe2describes the capability of improved electrical conductivity under",7.9,False,10,306.5936584472656,66.3322982788086,False,False,False,body

Thereafter,photoelectric current prevails under light illumination in stage-II.In the light off stage, the current goes to negative value andcomes back to zero in stage-III and IV.

Overall, the SnS/CdS nanostructurestrengthened visible light absorption under pyroelectric and pho-toelectric efﬁciency of nanostructured SnS nanoﬂakes and CdSnanorods.Understanding of photodetector performance by developing thelow-dimensional nanostructures is also necessary compared to theconventional thin ﬁlms, which manifest the superior photodetectorperformance.

In this system, WO3 NW was deposited on the SiO2/Sisubstrate. The electrode pattern was designed by standard photo-lithography method. Finally, Cu/Au electrodes were deposited usingthermal evaporation technique.

The superiorphotodetector performance is attributed to the formation of defectless nanowires, high crystallinity, and high surface-to-volume ratio(Zhu et al., 2016; Wen et al., 2016; Li et al., 2015; Cheng et al., 2017).In conclusion, favorable formation of graphene-based materials(doped and heterostructure based) and various nanostructuredmaterials are crucial for achieving the superior visible lightphotodetector performance. Among these, graphene-based heter-ostructure (GaN/SLG) achieved superior responsivity (400 A/W)and detectivity (208  1012 Jones) compared to the CdSe/MoS2nanocomposite (responsivity of 10.04 mA/W and detectivity of3.56  1011 Jones).

"Unlike the UV and visible light photodetector, infrared (IR)photodetectors are mainly employed in astronomy and defenceareas. In this situation, higher wavelengths are required to detectthe objects and targets. Defence applications include distinguishingdecoys from actual missiles, locating landmines during aircraftlanding, and identiﬁcation of warm targets against a warm back-ground. The current video camera industry has been dominated bythe basic charge coupled device (CCD) detector technology. How-ever, the latest technological advancements in mass production ofIR detectors led to include it in video camera applications as well.Therefore, it is necessary to develop the low-cost IR PDs with high-end device parameters such as sensitivity, spectral selectivity,working temperature, and peak wavelength (Zeng et al., 2013;Chakrabarti et al., 2004; Tezcan et al., 2003). Currently, HgCdTe-based IR photodetectors have been using in astronomical applica-tions, which possess superior responsivity and ultra-low noisedetection in the long-wave infrared regime (LWIR) (Elliott, 1998).But, high cost, non-uniformity over a large area, and lack of avail-ability of substrates are the limitations associated with the HgCgTe-based IR detectors (Rogalski, 2005). To overcome, InAs-(IneGa)Sbbased IR photodetectors were developed as alternative to theHgCdTe-based detectors, which showed promising features due totheir low dark-currents and high quantum efﬁciency (Claro et al.,2020; Wu et al., 2016b; Pan et al., 1998). Moreover, employing Siand InSb based materials are predicted to outperform the verylong-wave infrared regime (VLWIR) and mid-wave infrared regime(MWIR) performance (Tran et al., 2019; Xie et al., 2015). Surpris-ingly, IR detector technologies operate speciﬁcally at cryogenictemperatures and variation in the temperature would alter thedetection range of the device. For burgeoning the infrared detectortechnology, quantum well-infrared photodetectors (QWIPs) usedfor MWIR detection, which commercially well established in thecurrent market (Levine et al., 1992; Gunapala et al., 1991; W. Tanget al., 2018; Rodriguez et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2018). It is inter-esting to highlight that quantum dot infrared photodetectors(QDIPs) used for LWIR and VLWIR detection (Ramiro et al., 2020;Chen et al., 2020c). Speciﬁcally, QDIPs are commendable to over-come the QWIPs technology towards MWIR detection. Currently,various research groups involved in developing the promisingquantum dot technology for strengthening the optical propertiesdue to the fact that electrons are conﬁned in 3-D space (Keuleyanet al., 2011).

"In a bid to develop the IR photodetector, self-assembled 50layers of InAs QDs with 30 nm thickness of GaAs spacers separatingthem was developed on the <100> GaAs substrate (InAs/GaAsQDIPs). Then, InAs/GaAs QDIPs were sandwiched between thecollector and emitter (Liu et al., 2001). By this method, InAs/GaAsQDIPs attained responsivity about 0.1 A/W at an IR wavelength of5000 nm (80 K). Ideally, superior response range was provided bythe QDIPs under reduced density of states. In doing so, QDIPsresponsible for the variety of possible transitions, it become crucialfor the occupancy of QD states.Based on emerging IR photodetector of QDIPs, another com-posite based on GaAs QDIPs (InAs/InGaAs/GaAs QDIPs) was devel-oped by molecular beam epitaxy (Kim et al., 2004). In this work,differentmonolayer(ML)QDssuchasInAs(2-ML),In0.15Ga0.85As(20-ML) and GaAs(130-ML) have been utilized todevelop the InAs(2-ML)/In0.15Ga0.85As(20-ML)/GaAs(130-ML) het-erostructure. The resultant composite sandwiched between highlySi-doped GaAs as top and bottom contacts. Notably, the InAs/InGaAs/GaAs QDIPs framework exhibited superior detectivity about33  1011 Jones at 9.3 mm IR wavelength. Also, extreme low noise(1014 A/Hz1/2) was observed at 1.4 V and 78 K, which were higherthan the previously reported QDIPs (mention the value) (Ye et al.,2002). In conclusion, the optimized heterostructure of InAs/InGaAs/GaAs QDIPs have exhibited high responsivity of 700 mA/W,it was mainly attributed to the enlarged IR absorption underincreased QD layers.Similarly,Al0.3Ga0.7As/GaAsheterostructureincludingInAsquantum-dot (QD) layer with a 10 nm thick GaAs spacer wasdeveloped as a mid-infrared sensor (Murata et al., 2020). Thephotodetector developed on nþ-GaAs (001) substrate using mo-lecular beam epitaxy (MBE) technique. Later, intrinsic GaAs layer(300 nm), InAs QDs, GaAs capping layer (10 nm), and Al0.3Ga0.7Aslayer (20 nm) were sequentially developed. Au and AueGe elec-trodes were used to achieve the ohmic-contact behaviour betweenthe electrode and photo-active material. As a result, Al0.3Ga0.7As/GaAs composite exhibited the responsivity of 0.8 A/W at 295 K andspeciﬁc detectivity of 1.8  1010 Jones under 6.6 mm IR wavelengthillumination. The accumulated electrons at the interface of heter-ostructure transferred to the conduction band of Al0.3Ga0.7As bar-rier by means of two factors.

"In addition to the above InAs QDs community, PbS QDs alsostreamlined to achieve superior IR photodetection. Building uponthis knowledge on PbS QDs, graphene integrated PbS QDs identiﬁedas efﬁcient IR photodetector (Sun et al., 2012). To prove viability ofPbS QDs, graphene sheets were synthesized on the copper sub-strate by conventional CVD technique. Later, graphene sheets weretransferred onto the Si substrate. Finally, PbS QDs developed ontothe graphene using facile solution processing technique. Fig. 11 (a)presents the graphene modiﬁed PbS QDIP device structure. In thiscreative study, IR responsivity of PbS QDs based device signiﬁcantlyincreasedwithdecreaseoflightintensity(32.7mW/cm2 < 12.3 mW/cm2 < 221 nW/cm2 < 14.5 nW/cm2). They foundthat PbS QDIP device is capable of superior responsivity of 1  107A/W at a selective low IR light (895 nm) intensity of 14.5 nW/cm2 asshown in Fig. 11 (b).

The detectionrange was able to tune from 800 nm to the onset absorptionwavelength of the bottom-QD layer through the OTP/QD ss-PDs.Further, depending on the size of the QDs, we can achieve theessential IR detection range. Based on the above constructive fea-tures, QD ss-PDs achieved superior responsivity (15.6 mA/W) anddetectivity (1.3  1011 Jones) under IR light (930 nm). Therefore,introduction of OTP as a top layer can highly beneﬁcial for removalof non-target spectrum, which is energetically favorable for selec-tive IR detection.Another type of PbS QD based composite favorable for the IRphotodetector performance. Interestingly, graphene-PbS QD com-posite provided unique opportunity to study the near-infraredphotodetector performance (Jeong et al., 2020). Initially, single-layer graphene ﬂakes and PbS QDs capped with oleic acid wereseparately synthesized. Later, the solution was mixed using con-ventional sonication process in hexane solution. Finally, thegraphene-PbS QDs mixture was coated onto a glass substrate. Theinterdigitated ﬁnger patterns of Au electrodes were patterned ontotheSiO2substrateusingthephotolithography.Dueto theconstructiveinteractionbetweengrapheneandPbSQDs,graphene-PbS QDs composite exhibited higher photocurrent (5times), 22% of less rise time and 47% of shorter decay timecompared to the pure PbS QDs. Overall, the impressive enhance-ment in the photodetector performance mainly ascribed to thephoto-induced charge transportation in the graphene-PbS QDcomposite.Recently, the concept of large-scale production of spray depos-ited PbS QDs addressed for IR photodetector (Chen et al., 2020c).This approach also compared with the QD-solids prepared by thesimple spin-coating technique. The spray deposition technique al-lows the QDs to establish the dense packing. Fig. 12(a) presents thePbS QDs photodetector device structure.

"Further, adaptive single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs)combined with PbS QDs (SWCNT-PbSQD), which directed to ach-ieve IR photodetector performance (Y. Tang et al., 2018). ForSWCNT-PbSQD, SWCNTs were deposited on the Si/SiO2 substrateusing the dip-coating method. The interdigited electrode patternwas designed using electron beam lithography. Later, this patternallows to develop the Pd (3 nm) and Au (50 nm) electrodes usingthermal evaporation technique. Finally, PbS QD solution wasadapted as layer by layer using spin coating on SWCNTs. As a result,thedevelopedSWCNT-PbSQDarchitectureunderlinedtheresponsivity of 7.2 A/W, speciﬁc detectivity of 7.1  1010 Jones, andresponse time of 1.58 ms at IR wavelength of 1550 nm (141.47 mW/cm2). At the most fundamental level, internal electric ﬁeldapproximated the light-induced charge carrier separation at theinterface of SWCNT and PbSQDs. Overall, SWCNT-PbSQD combi-nation is essential for superior IR photoresponse and detectivity.In a similar vein, germanium quantum dot (GeQDs) infraredphotodetectors were developed at low temperature (<300 C)(Zhao et al., 2020). In this method, the SieGe bilayer was convertedinto Si/Ge heterostructured nanowires by rolling of indium (In)droplets at 300 C. Later, Indium droplets absorbed into the bilayerprecursor and self-modulated to produce GeQDs. Interestingly,SiNWs as a metal electrode demonstrated the possibility of supe-rior IR absorption. As a result, the developed samples have shownthe IR responsivity about 1.5 mA/W (at l ¼ 1550 nm). It demon-strates the possibility to integrate the individual GeQDs into Sicomplementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) circuits to-wards IR detection, high-density IR communication, and imaging.Colloidal nanocrystals also extensively used, since they have theability to achieve the broad spectral tunability (Livache et al., 2019).reported that energy landscape of quantum well and quantum dotIR photodetectors aped from combination of mercury selenide(HgSe) and mercury telluride (HgTe) nanocrystals. This strategicmetamaterial combination provides intraband absorption undersuperior transport properties such as fast time response, low darkcurrent, and large thermal activation energy. In such a way, theresponsivity and detectivity values were found to be ~5 mA/W and1.5  109 Jones, respectively at 80 K. The obtained results were veryless compared to the QDIPs (Deng et al., 2014). The reason behindthe less responsivity is lack of absorption through the very thinlayer of NCs.While the usage of ultrahigh mobility graphene exhibitspromising visible light photodetector performance, it is limited inthe IR region about 2% and resulting low responsivities. To studythe capability of IR photodetector performance, rGO combinedgraphene nanoribbons (GNR) were developed on SiO2/Si substrateusing drop casting method (Chitara et al., 2011). Here, two elec-trodes (Cr/Au) were coated in between rGO/GNR, which can giverise to the IR responsivity of 1 A/W.

Asa result, multilayer stacking can scale up the IR absorption capacityup to ~25%, which is comparatively higher than bi-layer (4.6%) andtri-layer (6.9%) of graphene under normal incident of IR light at1550 nm wavelength.In conclusion, we have systematically discussed the viability ofInAs and PbS based QDs towards efﬁcient IR photodetector per-formance.

Moreover, QDIPs based PbS QDs have shown improvedIR photodetector performance compared to the InAs-based pho-todetectors. In such a way, PbS-QDs/graphene composite achievedremarkable responsivity (107 A/W) under IR irradiation, whichattributed to the superior charge carrier transportation at theinterface under ultrahigh mobility of graphene. Also, the possibilityof deposition technique (spray deposition) makes the PbS QDsmore responsive to encourage the IR light (365 A/W) and detec-tivity (1.4  1012 Jones) under controlled higher density of PbS QDs.On the other hand, HgSe/HgTe nanostructures presented poorresponsivity due to absorption layer of HgSe/HgTe nanocrystals wasvery thin. The mechanism of generating photocurrent in QDIPs isdue to intraband excitation of electrons upon illumination withphotons. The photo-excitation of electrons takes place fromconﬁned states of conduction band dots to the continuum.Improved QDIPs performance could be due to lower dark currentattributed to the 3-D conﬁnement of electron wave function,reduction in thermal generation of electrons due to quantization ofenergy in all three dimensions, and ability to inter-sub-band ab-sorption even at normal incidence.

"different heterostructures (PQD/rGO, GaN/SLG, rGO/WSe2 andGeSn/graphene) and nanostructures (HgSe/HgTe NCs and WO3NWs) owning to their broad band spectral absorption and ultra-high mobility of graphene. However, due to the low absorptionrate of pure graphene, graphene-based composites (rGO-CZS, PQD-rGO, N-SLG, and GO doped PbI2) dedicated to improve the photo-response and EQE of resultant photodetector. It is to be noted thatphotogenerated charge carriers effectively separated at the heter-ostructure interface to enhance the responsivity and detectivity.Further, by synthesizing the nanostructures with high surface-to-volume ratio, the bandgap values were effectively tuned (WSe2and WO3), which was highly beneﬁcial for visible light absorptionand good responsivity. For IR photodetectors, mostly QD-basedmaterials (InAs QDs and PbS QDs) have been successfully utilized.Among all QDs, QDIPs showed excellent photoresponse in LWIRand MWIR owing to its 0-D quantum conﬁnement and ability toabsorb the light with any polarization.Although immense research is being conducted on photode-tector performance in various light regions, researchers furtherfacing many challenges in extruding the superior photosensitivity.Some of the future challenges and perspectives are presentedbelow.",7.83,False,18,37.5865478515625,66.3354721069336,False,False,False,body
"1) There is plenty of room for further improvement in theresponsivity and detectivity of the next-generation ﬂexiblephotodetectors.2) Also, we needed to convert them into self-powered PDs understrategic experimental methods.3) Controloverthecrystalgrowth,orientation,thickness,morphology, uniformity, and repeatability of the photodetectoris necessary.4) Scaling up of large-scale production and cost reduction requiredfor our future generations. As discussed in the present reviewpaper, several chemical methods have been adopted to syn-thesize different nanostructures, which succeeded band gaptuning. Nanostructured PDs exhibited higher photoresponsecompared to the thin ﬁlm PDs. However, they exhibited theultra-fast response to the incident radiation.5) The higher response time of nanostructure PDs limits theirapplicability in the development of ultrafast optoelectronic de-vices. On the other side, thin ﬁlms and heterostructured devicesshow fast response to the incident photons. Further, nano het-erostructureswereexhibitedhighresponsivityandlowresponse time. Hence, nano heterostructures based PDs shouldbe given more attention to address the current requirements inultrafast optoelectronic devices.6) Also, various physical fabrication methods to be employed toachieve longer lifecycles and scalability in photodetector ﬁeld.",8.13,False,18,38.15448760986328,306.9382019042969,False,False,True,body
