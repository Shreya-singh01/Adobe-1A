"(3) DOJ-OPR refers to the OIG allega-tions involving misconduct by Depart-ment attorneys or investigators that do not relate to the exercise of an at-torney’s authority to investigate, liti-gate, or provide legal advice. (4) The OIG and the FBI notify each other of the existence of criminal in-vestigations that fall within their joint jurisdiction to investigate crimes in-volving the operations of the Depart-ment, except where such notification could compromise the integrity of an investigation; (5) All Department components re-port to the OIG all non-frivolous alle-gations of criminal wrongdoing and se-rious administrative misconduct in-volving any of their employees except allegations involving Department at-torneys and investigators that relate to an attorney’s authority to litigate, investigate, or provide legal advice. (6) At the request of the Inspector General, the Deputy Attorney General may assign to the OIG a matter within the investigative jurisdiction of DOJ- OPR. In such instances, the OIG shall either: (i) Notify DOJ-OPR of its request to the Deputy Attorney General or (ii) Request that the Deputy Attor-ney General determine that such noti-fication would undermine the integrity of the investigation nor jeopardize the interests of the complainant. (7) While an issue of investigative ju-risdiction or assignment is pending be-fore the Deputy Attorney General, nei-ther the OIG DOJ-OPR shall undertake any investigative activity without au-thorization from the Deputy Attorney General. (b) OIG investigations that result in findings of potential criminal mis-conduct or civil liability are referred to the appropriate prosecutorial or litigative office. (c) The OIG advises DOJ-OPR of the existence and results of any investiga-tion that reflects upon the ethics, com-petence, or integrity of a Department attorney for appropriate action by DOJ-OPR.
