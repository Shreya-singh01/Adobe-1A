"Abstract: Hydrogels have emerged as promising biomaterials due to their excellent performance;however, their biocompatibility, biodegradability, and absorbability still require improvement tosupport a broader range of medical applications. This paper presents a new biofunctionalizedhydrogel based on in situ crosslinking between maleimide-terminated four-arm-poly(ethylene glycol)(4–arm–PEG–Mal) and poly(ε-lysine) (ε–PL). The PEG/ε–PL hydrogels, named LG–n, were rapidlyformed via amine/maleimide reaction by mixing 4–arm–PEG–Mal and ε–PL under physiologicalconditions. The corresponding dry gels (DLG–n) were obtained through a freeze-drying technique.1H NMR, FT–IR, and SEM were utilized to confirm the structures of 4–arm–PEG–Mal and LG–n(or DLG–n), and the effects of solid content on the physicochemical properties of the hydrogelswere investigated. Although high solid content could increase the swelling ratio, all LG–n samplesexhibited a low equilibrium swelling ratio of less than 30%. LG–7, which contained moderate solidcontent, exhibited optimal compression properties characterized by a compressive fracture strengthof 45.2 kPa and a deformation of 69.5%. Compression cycle tests revealed that LG–n demonstratedgood anti-fatigue performance. In vitro degradation studies confirmed the biodegradability of LG–n,with the degradation rate primarily governing the drug (ceftibuten) release efficiency, leading to asustained release duration of four weeks. Cytotoxicity tests, cell survival morphology observation,live/dead assays, and hemolysis tests indicated that LG–n exhibited excellent cytocompatibility andlow hemolysis rates (<5%). Furthermore, the broad-spectrum antibacterial activity of LG–n wasverified by an inhibition zone method. In conclusion, the developed LG–n hydrogels hold promisingapplications in the medical field, particularly as drug sustained-release carriers and wound dressings.",8.92,True,1,166.01699829101562,291.1195068359375,False,False,False,H2

"Hydrogels are three-dimensional networks of hydrophilic polymers that have highwater-retaining capabilities [1,2]. They can maintain structural integrity while swelling inaqueous medium or physiological fluids. The flexibility, tunable mechanical properties,and favorable biocompatibility make them ideal for various medical applications, includingdrug delivery [3,4], cell culture [5], tissue engineering [6–8], and wound healing [9,10]. Inrecent years, smart hydrogels with external triggers (temperature, electricity, magnetism,pH, light, etc.) have been developed for targeted-release drug delivery systems, which caneffectively reduce the side effects of drugs [11–13]. Many strategies are explored to preparehydrogels, including chemical reactions, and light- and heat-induced polymerizationreactions [14,15]. However, these approaches have drawbacks, including potential toxicity,delayed gelation, or requiring supplementary devices [16]. Moreover, most of the producedhydrogels exhibit instability and a concurrent loss of bioactivity due to their uncontrolled",9.96,False,1,165.97500610351562,627.5084228515625,False,False,False,body

"gelation chemistries [17,18]. Therefore, developing a simple and rapid method to preparebiodegradable hydrogels with high biocompatibility and biostability is significant forbroadening their applications in the medical field.Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) is a versatile nonionic polymer known for its high biocom-patibility, superior hydrophilicity, and non-toxicity [19]. The adjustment of its molecularweight and structure enables tailored applications in various pharmaceutical and medicalareas, such as in drug delivery systems to enhance solubility and bioavailability, in tissueengineering as scaffolds for cell growth, and in oncology through PEGylation to reduce im-munogenicity [20–22]. PEG-based hydrogels exhibited exceptional efficacy in guiding thebehavior of encapsulated cells due to their inherent resistance to protein adsorption [23,24].Recently, hydrogel systems made from multi-arm PEGs or their derivatives have beendesigned as promising scaffolds for applications in tissue engineering [25,26].ε-Poly(L–lysine) (ε–PL), a natural cationic antibacterial peptide, is composed ofε–lysine by isopeptide bonds [27,28]. This compound exhibited various beneficial prop-erties, including biocompatibility, biodegradability, water solubility, thermal stability, ed-ibility, and antibacterial effects [29,30]. The body can rapidly metabolize ε–PL throughits enzyme system into the monomer ε–lysine, which is subsequently absorbed, therebyminimizing the potential for accumulation and toxicity. Furthermore, the antibacterialcharacteristics of ε–PL effectively inhibit the growth and reproduction of various mi-croorganisms, which reduces the risk of infection and improves the safety of medicaldevices [31,32]. Consequently, ε–PL presents a promising biomedical material for variousapplications, such as antibacterial surface coatings, drug delivery systems, and protectivefilms [33–35]. However, the polycationic nature of ε–PL can lead to non-specific interactionswith cell membranes, potentially impacting drug targeting [36]. Additionally, its relativelyrapid degradation rate could influence the effectiveness of long-term drug release.In this paper, in situ crosslinked hydrogels were developed through the amine/maleimidereaction between maleimide-terminated four-arm-poly(ethylene glycol) (4–arm–PEG–Mal)and ε–PL under physiological conditions for medical application. 4–Arm–PEG–Mal wasfirst synthesized from a commercially available 4–arm−PEG−OH. Subsequently, PBSsolutions of 4–arm–PEG–Mal and ε–PL were mixed and sprayed using a double-barrelsyringe to rapidly produce hydrogels with varying solid content. The corresponding drygels were obtained through freeze drying. The effect of the solid content in hydrogels ontheir physicochemical characteristics (thermal properties, mechanical properties, swellingbehavior, degradation performance, and drug release properties) was investigated. The bio-compatibility of the hydrogels was preliminarily evaluated through cytotoxicity tests, cellsurvival morphology observation, live/dead assays, and hemolysis tests. Additionally, theantibacterial properties of the hydrogels were assessed using the inhibition zone method.",9.99,False,2,165.97500610351562,89.69732666015625,False,False,False,body

"Due to the electrophilicity of 4–arm–PEG–Mal and nucleophilicity of ε–PL, the electrophilic-nucleophilic substitution reactions easily occurred under mild conditions by mixing theirsolution at different pH values, resulting in the formation of crosslinked PEG/ε–PL hy-drogels (LG-n). Direct mixing of the two solutions yielded an inconsistent mixture, whichcompromised the hydrogel formation process. To address this, a double syringe equippedwith a helical mixing head (Figure 1) was adopted to facilitate complete reactions betweenthe two components, thereby promoting the formation of a homogeneous hydrogel. It pro-vided a more controlled, efficient, and scalable method for hydrogel formation comparedto direct mixing methods. After the 15 s of spraying, the mixture exhibited negligible flow,and by 40 s, the hydrogel had formed essentially.",9.95,False,2,165.97500610351562,592.3431396484375,False,False,False,body

"The chemical structures of ε–PL, 4–arm–PEG–Mal, and dry PEG/ε–PL gels (DLG–n)were characterized by FT-IR, and the spectra are displayed in Figure 2 (DLG–n sampleshave similar FT-IR spectra, and DLG–7 is taken as a representative sample). In the FT-IR spectrum of ε–PL (Figure 2a), the absorption peaks at 3233, 2930, 1663, 1551, 1250,and 508 cm−1 belonged to the stretching vibrations of N–H, C–H, amide I, amide II,C–N, and –NH–, respectively. In addition, a broad strong absorption was observed at3000~2800 cm−1, which was attributed to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibra-tions of –NH3+ [37]. 4–arm–PEG–Mal (Figure 2b) exhibited the characteristic absorptionof –CH2–, ester C=O, and ether C–O–C at 2870, 1735, and 1090 cm−1, respectively. Theweak peaks at 1774 and 1806 cm−1 were ascribed to the characteristic absorption of theC=O and amide groups in the maleimide ring. The maleimide groups were linked onlyat the end of the PEG chain, and their low content resulted in reduced absorption in-tensity, proving the successful synthesis of 4–arm–PEG–Mal. In the FT–IR spectrum ofDLG–7 (Figure 2c), the characteristic peaks of ε–PL and 4–arm–PEG–Mal were observed.The absorption peaks of –CH2–, ester C=O, amide I, amide II, ether C–O–C, and –NH–appeared at 2875, 1716, 1650, 1548, 1090, and 508 cm−1, respectively. The absorption inten-sity of –NH3+ (3000~2900 cm−1) showed a significant decrease, accompanied by a broaderband of amide (508 cm−1), which confirmed that the chemical reactions of maleimide/–NH2 indeed occurred and the cross-linked structures were formed. It was worth noting thatthe absorption peaks for ester C=O and amide I exhibited a blue shift, due to the H–bondsformed between C=O and –NH–. A similar phenomenon was also observed in our reportedpoly(ether-urethane) elastomers based on phenol-urethane bonds [38]. Additionally, thebroad peak at 3351 cm−1 corresponded to the absorption of residual moisture in the dry gel.",9.39,False,3,165.97500610351562,330.4421081542969,False,False,False,body

The dense pores enhanced the contactsurface between the dry gel and water molecules, thereby facilitating water retention inthe hydrogel.

"Figure 4 shows the TGA and DTG curves of ε–PL, 4–arm–PEG–Mal, and DLG–n,and the characteristic values derived from the curves are listed in Table 1. The pyrolysisprocess of ε–PL could be divided into two weight-loss stages, which was consistent withthe reported result [41]. The first stage occurred at low temperatures with a maximumtemperature (T1) of 315.0 ◦C belonged to the thermal decomposition of the amide bond inthe main chain. The slight weight loss in the second stage with T2 of 449.6 ◦C originatedfrom the decomposition of the organic salt in the side chain. The heat-resistant organicsalts resulted in a residual weight (Wr) of up to 14.6% at the end of the test. A two-stepweight loss was found in the thermal decomposition curves of 4–arm–PEG–Mal. The slightmass loss at 306.0 ◦C (T1) was attributed to the pyrolysis of ester bonds, and the main massloss at 405.6 ◦C (T2) belonged to the decomposition of ether bonds in the backbone [42].DLG–n with different solid content exhibited overlapped TGA curves, meaning similarthermal stability. It could be concluded that the solid content had little effect on the thermalstability of the dry gel. Only one weight-loss peak with T2 ranging from 411.2 to 421.0 ◦Cwas found in the DTG curves of DLG–n, manifesting good component compatibility. TheT5% of DLG–n appeared at ~370 ◦C, which was much higher than that of ε–PL (289.3 ◦C)and 4–arm–PEG–Mal (295.4 ◦C). The high initial thermal stability of DLG–n should beascribed to the three-dimensional network structure linked by covalent amide bondsand noncovalent H–bonds, which needed more energy to decompose. It indicated thatcrosslinking improved the heat resistance of DLG–n and a T5% higher than 200 ◦C meantthat the dry gels were suitable for high-temperature sterilization.",9.27,False,4,165.97500610351562,369.9571228027344,False,False,False,body

"The DSC curves for ε–PL, 4–arm–PEG–Mal, and DLG–n are presented in Figure 5,and the thermal transition values are summarized in Table 2. ε–PL exhibited a slightlyhigher glass transition temperature (Tg) at 13.4 ◦C, which was due to the NH3+ in the sidechain. As reported in the published paper, the Tg of 4–arm–PEG–Mal appeared at a lowtemperature of −50 ◦C, owing to its highly flexible ether bonds [43]. Only one Tg wasobserved in the crosslinked DLG–n curves, indicating good compatibility between PEGand ε–PL. The crosslinked network structure reduced the flexibility of the ether bonds,resulting in higher Tg values than 4–arm–PEG–Mal. The Tg values of approximately~−34 ◦C meant that DLG–n chains were in a highly flexible state at normal temperature,which was a crucial factor for enabling the mechanical properties of the hydrogels. Inaddition, both ε–PL and 4–arm–PEG–Mal displayed a distinct crystal melting endothermicpeak, appearing at 76–110 ◦C (Tn = 89.3 ◦C, ∆Hn= 43.9 J·g−1) and 24–37 ◦C (Tm = 31.7 ◦C,∆Hm= 28.1 J·g−1), respectively. Both endothermic peaks appeared in the DSC curves ofDLG–n; however, the corresponding ∆H values were significantly lower than those ofthe raw materials.

Theresults indicated that with an increase in solid content in hydrogels, both the SR and ESRexhibited a significant rise. This phenomenon can be attributed to two primary factors [44]:one is the hydrophilicity of the PEG segment, which increases with the rising solid content;another is the tighter network structure formed by the higher solid content. Consequently,high solid content could enhance the water–holding capacity of the hydrogel, resulting in aslower SR and a higher ESR.

When the solid content increased from 3% to11%, the fracture strength (σf) of LG–n hydrogels increased rapidly from 7.6 to 101.2 kPa,while the fracture deformation (εf) decreased gradually from 82.4 to 51.8%. The highersolid content could produce more crosslinking points in the hydrogel and form a densernetwork structure, which needed more energy against external pressure [45]. However, ahigher solid content could enhance the σf; excessively high solid content led to the hydrogelbecoming more brittle. Therefore, to obtain the optimum comprehensive performance, thesolid content of LG–n hydrogels should be maintained at a level not exceeding 11 wt%.To further illustrate the mechanical properties of the hydrogels, the cyclic compressivetest was performed to investigate their anti-fatigue performance. Taking LG–7 as a repre-sentative sample, the ε was set as 90% of the εf. Five successive loading–unloading testswere carried out, and the stress–strain profiles are displayed in Figure 7b. It was foundthat although the maximum compressive strength (σm) exhibited a slight decrease with theincrease in the cycle number, the stress recovery rates (the percentage of σm to the originalvalue [46]) were higher than 95%. In addition, the compressive hysteresis loops almostoverlapped during the five cycles, demonstrating that the hydrogels could rapidly recovertheir pristine shape after removing the external force [47]. The results indicated that thehydrogels possessed excellent elastic resilience and fatigue resistance.",9.73,False,6,165.89500427246094,472.9413146972656,False,False,False,body

"After serving a temporary application in the body, the medical hydrogels are expectedto degrade, with degradation products being absorbable or metabolizable by the livingbody. In vitro degradation of the fabricated LG–n hydrogels was carried out in PBS (pH 7.4)at 37 ◦C using a gravimetric method, and the time-dependent mass loss is shown in Figure 8.All samples showed a rapid mass loss during the first two weeks, which was due to thedissolution of the uncrosslinked molecular chains. After degradation for 12 weeks, themass loss for LG–3, –7, and –11 was 33.3%, 12.9%, and 8.2%, respectively. The degradationrate reduced with the increase in solid content. Higher solid content contributed to theformation of more compact crosslinked networks, which restricted the contact of watermolecules with hydrolyzable amide and ester bonds, resulting in enhanced hydrolyticstability. Thus, the degradation rate of LG–n could be controlled by adjusting the solidcontent. It was inferred that the final hydrolytic degradation products of the hydrogels werePEG and ε–lysine, which could be absorbed and metabolized by the body, respectively.",9.77,False,7,166.0050048828125,272.8663330078125,False,False,False,body

"Ceftibuten (CFB), a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic, is effective against awide range of GP and GN bacteria. It is recognized for its favorable pharmacokineticproperties and remains widely used in the treatment of respiratory tract infections, otitismedia, and uncomplicated urinary tract infections [48,49]. Figure 9 shows the in vitrodrug release profiles of CFB from LG–n in PBS (pH 7.4) at 37 ◦C. Relatively high drugrelease rates were observed in the initial two weeks, which was the burst release of drugmolecules attached to the surface of the hydrogel. After that, the rate gradually sloweddown with time. Because the amide groups of CFB could form H–bonds with the amidegroups of the crosslinked PEG/ε–PL chain, it was difficult for drug molecules to diffuseout of the hydrogel. Hence, the drug release rate in this stage was primarily controlledby the degradation of the hydrogel.

The antibacterial activity of LG–n hydrogels againstE. coli and S. aureus was measured by the inhibition zone method, and the results arepresented in Figure 13. The absence of an inhibition zone in the negative control indicatedno antibacterial activity. Obvious inhibition zones were formed around the LG–n, demon-strating their effectiveness in resisting the growth of E. coli and S. aureus. The antibacterialcapacity increased gradually with the increase in solid content in hydrogels, which wasreflected by the increased diameter of the inhibition zone from LG–3 to LG–11. The antibac-terial activity was primarily attributed to the residual –NH2 of ε–PL, which could interactwith peptidoglycan on the bacterial cell wall [53]. Tan’s groups demonstrated that ε–PLcould induce the structural change in peptidoglycan, which led to the destruction of the cellwall, the release of intracellular fluid, and the death of bacteria [54]. The larger inhibitionzones were achieved against E. coli than S. aureus, indicating higher antibacterial activity ofLG–n for GN bacteria than GP bacteria. This should be due to the thicker peptidoglycanlayers and external lipid membranes in GP bacteria [55].
