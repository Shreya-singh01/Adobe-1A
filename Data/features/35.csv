"Abstract: Hydrogels have emerged as promising biomaterials due to their excellent performance;however, their biocompatibility, biodegradability, and absorbability still require improvement tosupport a broader range of medical applications. This paper presents a new biofunctionalizedhydrogel based on in situ crosslinking between maleimide-terminated four-arm-poly(ethylene glycol)(4–arm–PEG–Mal) and poly(ε-lysine) (ε–PL). The PEG/ε–PL hydrogels, named LG–n, were rapidlyformed via amine/maleimide reaction by mixing 4–arm–PEG–Mal and ε–PL under physiologicalconditions. The corresponding dry gels (DLG–n) were obtained through a freeze-drying technique.1H NMR, FT–IR, and SEM were utilized to confirm the structures of 4–arm–PEG–Mal and LG–n(or DLG–n), and the effects of solid content on the physicochemical properties of the hydrogelswere investigated. Although high solid content could increase the swelling ratio, all LG–n samplesexhibited a low equilibrium swelling ratio of less than 30%. LG–7, which contained moderate solidcontent, exhibited optimal compression properties characterized by a compressive fracture strengthof 45.2 kPa and a deformation of 69.5%. Compression cycle tests revealed that LG–n demonstratedgood anti-fatigue performance. In vitro degradation studies confirmed the biodegradability of LG–n,with the degradation rate primarily governing the drug (ceftibuten) release efficiency, leading to asustained release duration of four weeks. Cytotoxicity tests, cell survival morphology observation,live/dead assays, and hemolysis tests indicated that LG–n exhibited excellent cytocompatibility andlow hemolysis rates (<5%). Furthermore, the broad-spectrum antibacterial activity of LG–n wasverified by an inhibition zone method. In conclusion, the developed LG–n hydrogels hold promisingapplications in the medical field, particularly as drug sustained-release carriers and wound dressings.",8.92,True,1,166.01699829101562,291.1195068359375,False,False,False,H2
