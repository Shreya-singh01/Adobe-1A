"of individual optoelectronic units com-posed of bulk polycrystalline thin films or single crystals of perovskite materials.[11–14] From the view of many practical appli-cations, development of optoelectronic device arrays are essential for diverse inte-grated optoelectronic devices and systems, which requires controllable and precise growth of high-quality patterned perov-skite materials with designed shapes.[15,16] The conventional photolithography pro-cess is the most extensively employed and useful technique for micropatterning of functional materials in the current semi-conductor industry.[17] However, the direct application of this technique for patterning perovskite materials has been ruled out because of the solubility of perovskites in many polar and protic solvents and the sensitivity of the organic component in perovskites.[18,19]",8.61,False,1,385.6784973144531,212.7467803955078,False,False,False,body
"To circumvent the above dilemma, a number of methods have been developed recently. For example, large-scale parallel aligned perovskite micro/nanowire arrays or vertically standing perovskite nanowire arrays have been successfully realized through self-assembly of perovskite precursors assisted by techniques such as blade-coating,[20,21] periodical geometrical confinement,[22–24] or periodical template guiding.[25–27] How-ever, it is rather difficult to precisely control the crystal shape using these methods, which limits the advance in integrated devices and systems. In addition, wafer-scale preparation of perovskite microplate crystals has also been realized through some methods including vapor-phase conversion,[28] chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth,[29] or wettability-mediated tem-plate method.[30] Nevertheless, homogenous prepatterned seed layers or complex templates are always required, which needs expensive apparatuses and renders the fabrication process extremely complicated and costly. What is more, the involve-ment of high temperature or unusual substrates also makes these techniques not applicable for use in applications like flex-ible and deformable optoelectronic devices. On the other hand, solution-processed spin-coating technique at relatively mild reaction condition has proven to be an effective way for pre-paring high-quality perovskite films toward high-performance and cost-effective optoelectronics. Very recently, by utilizing the wetting/dewetting behavior of perovskite precursor solutions",8.56,False,1,306.1370849609375,443.7484130859375,False,False,False,body
"Controlled growth of high-quality patterned perovskite films on a large scale is essentially required for the application of this class of materials in functional integrated devices and systems.

Such a facile fabrication technique is compatible with a range of spin-coated perovskite materials, perovskite manufacturing processes, and substrates. By employing this growing method, controllable perovskite photodetector arrays are realized, which have not only prominent photoresponse properties with a responsivity and specific detectivity of 4.8 AW−1 and 4.2 × 1012 Jones, respec-tively, but also relatively small pixel-to-pixel variation.

"on hydrophilic/hydrophobic surface produced by photolithog-raphy prepatterned organic self-assembly monolayers (SAMs) or polymer layers, several groups have achieved the deposition of patterned perovskite films with designed shapes on rigid or flexible substrates via spin-coating technique.[31–33] Based on these techniques, high-performance optoelectronic devices like semitransparent perovskite solar cells, ultrathin perovskite-on-Si multiplexed image sensor arrays, and flexible perovskite photo­detector arrays have also been demonstrated. In spite of these exciting progresses, some inevitable limitations still exist in the above-mentioned techniques. For example, normally, high-quality and continuous organic SAMs can only be suc-cessfully modified onto some special substrates, which restricts the vast applications of the techniques. Also, the processes of modification of organic SAMs and removal of residual polymer layers often involve the use of toxic organic solvents, making these techniques environmental unfriendly.Inspired by the above studies, we herein put forward a hydrophilic/hydrophobic surface-induced large-scale growth of high-quality patterned Cs-doped FAPbI3 perovskite films with high yield through one-step spin-coating process assisted by CVD-grown graphene films. As we all know, CVD-graphene possesses a natural hydrophobic surface due to airborne con-taminants and moisture adsorption,[34] and it can also be trans-ferred onto arbitrary substrates in principle.[35] Therefore, the proposed technique is compatible not only with a variety of spin-coated perovskite materials and perovskite manufacturing process but also with many substrates enabling some specific applications like next-generation flexible and deformable optoelectronics. With this technique, we obtained 6 × 6 perov-skite photodetector arrays, which display good photoresponse characteristics in terms of decent responsivity and specific detectivity of 4.8 AW−1 and 4.2 × 1012 Jones, with narrow pixel-to-pixel deviation. Furthermore, it is found that these photo­detector arrays can work as a visible light image sensor, exhibiting a reasonable spatial resolution.

"Figure 1a shows the schematic illustration of the procedures for preparing patterned perovskite films. First, a high-quality con-tinuous CVD-grown graphene film was transferred onto a pre-cleaned SiO2/Si substrate through a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA)-assisted transfer method. After removing PMMA with acetone, a solution of positive photoresist was spin-coated onto the graphene layer to generate a photoresist layer, and a standard photolithography process was employed to define the photoresist with desired micropatterns. Afterward, the sub-strate was treated with oxygen plasma to selectively remove exposed graphene and render a hydrophilic surface within the region of the micropatterns. The residual photoresist was then removed by acetone, leaving graphene layer with dupli-cated micropatterns atop the substrate. Subsequently, a solu-tion of FA0.85Cs0.15PbI3 perovskite precursors was spin-coated onto the substrate. During this process, the solution was prone to migrate to the hydrophilic region (oxygen plasma–treated oxide layer) due to the spontaneous dewetting property on the hydrophobic region (graphene layer), which was confirmed by a much larger contact angle of the solution on graphene layer (83.4o) than that on oxygen plasma–treated oxide layer (22.1o) (Figure 1b). Meanwhile, due to the centrifugal force of the spin-ning, the excess solution on graphene layer would be removed from the substrate. Finally, after thermal annealing and removal of graphene via another oxygen plasma treatment, a perovskite film with desired micropatterns was obtained on the substrate.The quality of the as-prepared patterned perovskite films was then probed by performing morphological and structural characterizations.

"scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images of perovskite films of periodic square and round array patterns with different magnifications. Obviously, the as-grown films had uniform and regular shapes with sharp edges, verifying the selective growth of the perovskite film on the substrate. We noted that there exist some undesired particles outside the patterned regions, which was likely due to the contaminants or cracks on graphene that can reduce the hydrophobicity of the underlying surface. Such a situation could be avoided by improving the graphene quality and optimizing graphene transfer processes in future work. Fur-thermore, from a magnified FESEM image plotted in Figure 2d, it was observed that the patterned perovskite film possessed compact and uniform surface with few pinholes and cracks, implying the homogenous growth of the perovskite within the hydrophilic region. Apart from periodic arrays, the proposed technique can be applied to prepare perovskite films with other micropatterns as well. Figure 2e–g presents an FESEM image of perovskite films arranged in an HFUT character. In addition, meander lines of perovskite films with widths of 50 and 25 µm, respectively, have also been realized. As shown in Figure  2g, even with the space width of only 25 µm, continuous lines of perovskite film with clear edges can still be realized. These results undoubtedly show that the present graphene-assisted patterned growth method holds a great possibility for fabrication of other materials for multifunctional purposes.Besides the convenience to achieve various desired pattern, the graphene-assisted growth method can also allow us to obtain smooth perovskite film with a root mean square roughness of only ≈9.71 nm, as shown by a 3D atomic force micro­scopy (AFM) image scanned in a representative area of 3 × 3 µm2 (Figure 3a). Such roughness is close to that of standard perov-skite layer without graphene (≈10.2 nm, shown in Figure S2,",8.95,True,3,51.023590087890625,366.7484130859375,False,False,False,body

Statistical analysis of the 36 patterned perovskite films in Figure  3b reveals that the thickness is in the range of 0.95–1.76 µm, with an average value of ≈1.3 µm, according to the cross-sectional FESEM image (Figure  3c). What is more, as depicted in Figure 3d, the diffraction peaks in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the sample can be all assigned to the black phase of FAPbI3 perovskite, which coin-cides with that of FA0.85Cs0.15PbI3 perovskites in literatures,[36] and discloses the fine crystallinity of the as-prepared perovskite arrays via the one-step spin-coating method.By using the above graphene-assisted growth technique, we then fabricated an optical image sensor composed of 6 × 6 pixels perovskite thin film photodetector arrays. The detailed fabrica-tion process is similar to the above-mentioned preparation pro-cedures except for the use of a SiO2/Si substrate with predefined Au parallel electrodes arrays, as schematically demonstrated in Figure S1 in the Supporting Information.

"white light illumination was also investigated. As depicted in Figure 4c, the detector responded steadily and repeatedly to the incident irradiation, giving a relatively large Ilight/Idark ratio of ≈102 at 1 V bias voltage.The photoresponse of the device depended strongly on the intensity of the incident light. Figure 4d displays the I–V curves under white light illumination with varied intensities. Appar-ently, the channel current increased monotonously from 2.54 to 45.2 nA when changing the light intensity from 37.6 µW cm−2 to 4.51 mW cm−2 at 3 V bias voltage, which can be ascribed to the increased population of photoexcited charge carriers upon illumi-nation with a stronger light intensity. In addition, the photocur-rent curve as a function of light intensity can be well fitted by an extensively used power law: I ∝ Pθ, where the exponent θ denotes an empirical value related to the recombination activity of photo­carriers.[37] As shown in Figure 4e, fitting the curve rendered a θ value of 0.59, which deviated significantly from the ideal value (θ = 1). Such a large deviation indicated the presence of strong recombination loss in the current perovskite photodetector, which was likely due to the carrier recombination occurred at abundant grain boundaries and surface trap states in the perovskite film.[38]",8.53,False,4,47.724037170410156,388.7484130859375,False,False,False,body

"where Ilight and Idark represent channel current under illumi-nation and in dark, Pin represents the incident light intensity, S represents the effective illuminating area (300 × 10 µm2 here), and e represents the elementary charge, respectively. Based on the above equations, R and D* were calculated to be 1.2 AW−1 and 9.5 × 1011 Jones (cmHz1/2 W−1), respectively, at a light intensity of 37.6 µW cm−2. The R and D* values were somewhat lower than those of a photodetector based on FA0.85Cs0.15PbI3 perovskite films prepared via the conventional one-step spin-coating method (at a white light intensity of 0.6 µW cm−2),[36] which was probably caused by the following reasons. First, our patterned perovskite device had a much thicker perovskite active layer, which led to a larger dark cur-rent. In addition, the collection of photocarriers would be less effective in devices with bottom electrode contacts in compar-ison with those with top electrode contacts, considering that optical absorption taken place at the top side. Finally, as will be discussed later, light illumination with a lower intensity was more favorable for achieving a higher R and therefore a higher D*. Figure  4f plots the dependence of R on the light inten-sity. Obviously, the R was negatively correlated with the light intensity, which further manifested the existence of strong recombination loss in the device. As a matter of fact, in such a photodetector, partial of photoexcited minority carriers are normally captured by sensitizing traps in the active layer, while photoexcited majority carriers transport across the channel to produce photocurrent.[39,40] Therefore, at a higher light inten-sity, saturation of sensitizing traps from minority carriers leads to intensified recombination activity of electrons and holes because of increased concentration of photocarriers.[41]",8.44,False,4,303.315673828125,388.7480773925781,False,False,False,body

"and 808 nm, respectively (Figure 5c and Figures S2b and S3b, Supporting Information). The obtained different θ values sug-gest that there are some differences between processes of photo­carrier generation and recombination in the device under varied light wavelengths.[42] Similarly, the R values declined monotonously with increasing light intensity as well (Figure 5d and Figures S2c and S3c, Supporting Information), and the maximum R and D* were calculated to be 4.8 AW−1 and 4.2 × 1012 Jones, respectively, under 650 nm illumination with a light intensity of 23.1 µW cm−2. Figure 5e plots the spectral response of the device recorded at a fixed light intensity in the wavelength range of 300–900 nm. Clearly, the device displayed a broadband photoresponse with the maximum response located at the visible light region. The photoresponse declined rapidly at longer wavelength when the light wavelength exceeding ≈760 nm, which corresponded to the band-edge absorption of the FA0.85Cs0.15PbI3 perovskite.[36]",8.43,False,6,48.187591552734375,388.7484130859375,False,False,False,body
"Response speed that reflects the ability of a photodetector to track fast-varying optical signal was also studied. Figure 5f plots an individual cycle of photoresponse curve of the detector under 650 nm illumination with a modulation frequency of 20 kHz.

Furthermore, the rise and decay times (τr and τf, defined as the duration needed for the photoresponse to rise (decay) from 10% (90%) to 90% (10%)) were estimated to be 13.7 and 14.9 µs, respectively.[43] Such a rapid response speed is comparable with that of an ambipolar perovskite film phototransistor (6.5/5.0 µs),[44] and much faster than a perov-skite network photodetector (0.3/0.4 ms) in previous studies.[45]",8.52,False,6,48.187591552734375,575.7483520507812,False,False,False,body
"To verify the feasibility of the perovskite photodetector arrays for device integration purpose, the uniformity of photoresponse performance of all the 6 × 6 pixel devices was further explored. Here, a homogenous white light irradiation (1.5 mW cm−2) was used to illuminate the photodetector arrays, and the dark current and photocurrent of each pixel device were recorded separately. For ease of comparison, the results were summarized in the form of 2D contrast maps with varied colors denoting different current levels, as shown in Figure 6a,b. Apparently, all the detec-tors in the optical sensor can work properly. Careful analysis found that the majority of pixels had dark currents in the range of tens of picoamperes (pA) and photocurrents in the range of several nanoamperes (nA) at a 1 V bias voltage, indicating a closed photoresponse performance. The average dark cur-rent and photocurrent were found to be ≈37.5 pA and ≈4.7 nA, respectively (Figure  6c). Notably, although there was a pixel-to-pixel variation in device performance, the dark current and photocurrent held nearly the same deviation tendency from the average values for each pixel device. In other words, each pixel device had both higher or lower dark current and photo­current in comparison with their respective average values. Such a phenomenon was probably ascribed to the fluctuation in the thickness of the patterned perovskite films in photo­detector arrays. In addition, the Ilight/Idark ratio of all the pixel devices was extracted and plotted in Figure  6d. It is obvious that the majority of the devices exhibited a large Ilight/Idark ratio exceeding 102, suggesting that the detected optical signal can be clearly distinguished from the background signal. Therefore, the present perovskite photodetector arrays possessed a huge potential for application as a visible light image sensor.",8.66,True,6,303.3167724609375,388.7484130859375,False,False,False,body

"Finally, the capability of perovskite photodetector arrays to record visible light image was explored. To conduct the meas-urement, a lab-built metal mask with “H” pattern was placed between the homogenous illumination and the photodetector arrays. As schematically shown in Figure 7a, only light pene-trated the hollow region of the mask can be projected on the pixels, whereas the rest of the pixels were kept in dark condi-tion without illumination. The channel current of each pixel was measured and then incorporated into a 2D contrast map. Totally, three kinds of light sources including white light, illu-mination with wavelengths of 450 and 650 nm, were employed here. As observed in Figure  7b–d, for all three illuminations, only the pixels projected by the illumination displayed size-able photocurrent, whereas the rest of the pixels showed weak channel current. Therefore, the shape of character “H” can be clearly identified in the contrast maps, implying the preliminary visible light imaging function of the perovskite photo­detector arrays. The spatial resolution can be optimized by further miniaturizing the pixel devices. Given a response speed much faster than the time resolution of human eyes (≈42 ms), pat-terned perovskite-based visible light image sensors developed by the proposed technique are expected to have some important applications, e.g., artificial electronic eyes.[20]",8.91,True,7,51.02458190917969,355.7484130859375,False,False,False,body

After thermal annealing at 70 °C for 5 min and subsequent 135 °C for 10 min, a black-brownish perovskite film was obtained on the substrate.The morphology and composition of the as-obtained perovskite films were characterized by an FESEM (SIRION 200 FEG) and an XRD (Rigaku D/max-rB), respectively.

"SiO2/Si substrates were measured using an optical contact angle system (CAM, Dataphysics OCA25).Device Fabrication and Analysis: To fabricate the perovskite photodetector arrays, 50 nm parallel Au electrodes arrays with 10 µm channel length were first deposited onto a clean SiO2/Si substrate through combined conventional photolithography, electron beam evaporation, and lift-off processes. Afterward, a CVD-graphene film was transferred atop the substrate, and then defined using another photolithography process followed by an oxygen plasma treatment to produce a patterned graphene film with 300 × 300 µm2 exposed hydrophilic regions which intentionally overlap with the device channels. Finally, patterned perovskite films were grown followed the above preparation procedures and the residual graphene was removed by another oxygen plasma treatment.Optoelectronic characterizations of the devices were conducted on a semiconductor characterization system (Keithley 4200-SCS), equipped with a monochromator (SP 2150, Princeton Co.). White light emitted from an optical microscope on the probe station and laser diodes with different wavelengths (405, 650, and 808 nm, Tanon UV-100) were used as the light sources. Before use, the light intensity of these light sources was carefully calibrated by a power meter (Thorlabs GmbH, PM 100D). For response speed measurement, the detector was illuminated by a high-frequency light irradiation emitted from a laser diode driven by a signal generator (Tektronix, 521TDS2022B), and the output photoresponse signal was recorded by an oscilloscope (Tektronix, DPO5104B).
