Abstract: Fluorescence spectroscopy is an optical spectroscopic method that has been applied for theassessment of environmental quality extensively during the last 20 years. Most of the earlier workshave used conventional light sources in spectroﬂuorometers to assess quality. Many recent workshave used laser sources of light for the same purpose. The improvement of the energy sources and ofthe higher resolution spectrometers has led to a tremendous increase in applications. The motivationfor the present review study is the increasing use of laser sources in environmental applications.The review is divided in two parts. The fundamental principles of ﬂuorescence spectroscopy aredescribed in the ﬁrst part. The environmental applications are described in the second part.,8.97,True,1,166.0439910888672,250.91635131835938,False,False,False,body

"Optical spectroscopy deals with the study of interactions between matter and lightsuch as absorption, emission and scattering, among others. Fluorescence spectroscopy (orﬂuorometry) is based on the emission of photons from a substance after excitation fromlight absorption. The molecules, due to their vibrational energy levels, emit light of lowerenergy (longer wavelength) than the absorbed light. This is called Stokes’ shift and happensdue to an energy loss in non-radiative decay. These processes are shown in the so-calledJablonski diagram in Figure 1a. When a molecule is in the ground level (S0) and absorbsa photon of sufﬁcient energy, an electron is promoted to a higher energy singlet level (S1or S2) equal to the energy of the absorbed photon. If the electron, following a relaxationpathway, returns to its original state emitting a photon, it is called photoluminescence. Thetwo types of photoluminescence are ﬂuorescence and phosphorescence. Fluorescence refersto when the electron from a singlet excited level decays radiatively to the ground singletstate, within a characteristic decay time of the order of 10−10 s to 10−7 s. Phosphorescenceoccurs when the electron, after a transition from a singlet excited state to a triplet state,returns radiatively to the ground singlet state. Since the last process involves change of theelectron spin, the phosphorescence time could be from 10−6 s up to seconds.For a compound, its emission spectrum and absorption spectrum (excitation spectrum)are usually almost mirror images as shown in Figure 1b for the radiative transition from S0to S1 and vice versa. This symmetry is attributed to the same vibrational levels structuresthat are involved in each of these processes.",9.39,False,1,166.09500122070312,444.55438232421875,False,False,False,body

"Fluorescence excitation can be induced by a lamp, a light-emitting diode (LED) ora laser source. When a laser is used for the excitation, the ﬂuorescence is called laserinduced ﬂuorescence (LIF). As lamps are conventional sources of light, the ﬂuorescence isconsidered as conventional in that case. For multispectral light sources, a spectral ﬁlter ormonochromator is used for selecting the excitation wavelength.Typically, the commercial spectroﬂuorometers utilize arc-lamps as light sources for theexcitation of compounds. The main sources used for ultraviolet (UV) and visible light arehigh-pressure and low-pressure lamps of Xenon (Xe) and mercury (Hg). The line spectrumemission of low-pressure Hg-Ar and Hg lamps are used mainly for calibration purposes.The high-pressure Xe and Hg lamps provide broadband light emissions from 250 nm and",9.97,False,2,166.0850067138672,660.5843505859375,False,False,False,body

"from 350 nm, respectively, up to IR. The intensities of high-pressure Hg lamps are highercompared with Xe lamps. There are also high-pressure Xe-Hg lamps with higher intensitiesthan Xe lamps. Deuterium lamps are also used, providing continuum emission in UV, from160 nm to 400 nm. The tungsten-halogen lamps are less used in ﬂuorescence spectroscopythan the previously mentioned ones due to their weak light emission below 400 nm [2].In the last two decades, the light-emitting diodes (LEDs) began to appear as lightsources in spectroﬂuorometers. The LED is an electroluminencence device that producesphoton emission by the recombination of electrons with electron holes at semiconductorjunction. They are inexpensive light sources with bright illumination and the develop-ment of LEDs emitted up to deep UV range make them very attractive for ﬂuorescenceexcitation [3].The laser sources are categorized in four types according to the active medium: solidstate, gas, liquid and semiconductors/diode lasers. Among the solid state lasers, theNeodynium-doped Yttrium/Aluminium Garnet (Nd: YAG) is the most common type usedin ﬂuorescence spectroscopy [4]. The fundamental wavelength of the laser is in the infrared(IR) at 1064 nm but with the use of nonlinear crystal the second or higher harmonics couldbe produced, providing laser wavelength at 532 nm, 355 nm, 266 nm or even 213 nm.The most common gas lasers include argon ion, HeNe, nitrogen and excimers [5].Argon ion lasers emit radiation at 488 nm (blue) and 514 nm (green); hence, they are calledalso blue-green lasers. They are relatively large lasers and external cooling is required.Helium-neon (HeNe) lasers operate at a single wavelength of light, most often at 632 nm.They do not produce high-power light (from few to tens mW), but they are more stable andare often used for metrology applications. HeNe lasers are more compact than argon ionlasers and do not require external cooling. Another type of gas lasers used in spectroscopyare nitrogen lasers, which operate in the UV range, as they emit radiation at 337 nm. Theyhave been used for air pollution monitoring. Excimer lasers are another type of gas lasersfor UV emission. The laser medium are short-live dimeric molecules generated in excitedstate of inner nobble gas atoms themselves (excimer) such as argon, krypton, xenon or bytheir combination with halogens (exciplex) such as ﬂuorine or chlorine gas atoms.The liquid lasers consist of a dye as lasing material. An organic dye dissolved in wateror other solvent (at a typical concentration of the order of 1 part in 10000), is radiated byan intense light source [6]. After the absorption of light in one wavelength, the dye emitslight over a broad range of visible wavelengths. Different dyes can produce a variety ofwavelength emissions. Coumarin and Rhodamine are some of the most used dyes [7,8].By changing the cavity length, or through other techniques, the output wavelength can beeasily tuned in a wide range of tens of nm. Their drawbacks are that the dye undergoesphotodecomposition and needs to be renewed by circulation, either in a container cell oras stream of jet in open air. In addition, the dyes are hazardous toxic materials and greatattention when handling them is needed.The last category of lasers is the diode (or semiconductor) lasers that work on asomewhat different principle. Light is emitted by ﬂowing electrical current through thesemiconductor due to the energy gap in the diode’s junction. They are compact lasers thatemit wavelengths typically from visible to IR, but recently there are devices emitting in theUV region [9]. Their output has a wide range of power from low to moderate. They havesmall size, are lightweight and less expensive than other lasers [10].Generally, the choice of laser type depends on the wavelength range that is neededin each research. The application of laser depends on the properties (monochromaticity,directionality, spatial and temporal characteristics) of the laser beam.",9.98,False,3,165.89500427246094,97.64241027832031,False,False,False,body

The ﬂuorescence light is detected and quantiﬁed either by a photomultiplier tube(PMT) or avalanche photodiodes (APD) or by a charge-coupled device (CCD). The majorityof commercial ﬂuorometers use photomultiplier tubes (PMT) to detect the low light intensityof ﬂuorescence [2].

"incident photon induces electron emission, a series of dynodes for electron multiplicationand an anode. The material that the photocathode is made from determines the spectralrange of the photomultiplier. In order to cover the whole UV-visible range, two types ofphotocathodes are required.The APD is another low-intensity light detector used in ﬂuorescence spectroscopy.In a photodiode an electron-hole pair generated when a photon is captured in the diodejunction area. In APD, a high reverse bias voltage creates a strong electric ﬁeld where theelectron generated from photon is accelerated to produce secondary electrons by impactionization. The resulting electron avalanche produces measurable electrical signal evenfrom few photons [11].Another type of detector used in ﬂuorometers is the CCD with which the wholeﬂuorescence spectrum can be analyzed at once without the need for wavelength scanningwith a monochromator. It is mainly used when the emitted light is of higher intensity, suchas in LIF. The CCD consists of an array of semiconductive photosensitive elements (pixels)where photons induce an electrical charge which is accumulatively stored in each of them.Then, the read out of each element charge is made in series by shifting the charge of eachelement to their neighbor toward the charge measurement circuit where it is also digitized.Typical schemes of a conventional and a laser induced ﬂuorescence system are shownin Figure 2.",9.98,False,4,165.97500610351562,97.67092895507812,False,False,False,body

"The compounds that absorb visible and/or UV light are called chromophores. Thecompounds that emit light are called ﬂuorophores. Compounds with ﬂuorescent char-acteristics are those with several aromatic (fused) rings and/or with conjugated doublebonds. There are two types of ﬂuorophores depending on the groups: those with electron-donating groups, such as -OH, -NH2 and -OCH3 that increase ﬂuorescence, and thosewith electron-withdrawing groups, such as COOH and -N=N- that reduce ﬂuorescence.There are some exceptions, for example ﬂuorophores such as tryptophan and tyrosine, thatshowed lower quantum yields than expected [12]. Compounds such as halogens, oxygenand acrylamide are also known to reduce ﬂuorescence and will be described in the nextsection. Heterocyclic compounds do not ﬂuoresce signiﬁcantly unless they are attached toan aromatic ring.The major characteristics of a ﬂuorophore include the ﬂuorescence lifetime (τF) and thequantum yield (Φ). Fluorescence lifetime is deﬁned as the average time that the moleculeremains in the excited state before it returns to its ground state, of the order of ns. Thequantum yield is deﬁned as the ratio of the number of the emitted photons to the numberof the excited molecules. The higher the quantum yield, the higher is the ﬂuorescence.

"The factors that affect ﬂuorescence include solvents, temperature, pH and ionicstrength as well as the presence of other substances. The decrease in ﬂuorescence in-tensity caused by any factor is called quenching, while the substances that may inducethis are called quenchers. The decrease in the ﬂuorescence intensity happens either byintramolecular or by intermolecular interactions.One of the most frequently present quenchers is the molecular oxygen which quenchesalmost all known ﬂuorophores. Other quenchers are acrylamide, amines and halogens.Table 1 summarizes examples for quenchers of some typical ﬂuorophores. There aretwo mechanisms of quenching: static and dynamic. Static quenching happens when anon-ﬂuorescent complex is formed between the ﬂuorophore and the quencher. Dynamicquenching, otherwise called collisional quenching, happens when the quencher interfereswith the ﬂuorophore during the lifetime of the excited state. The excited molecule isthen deactivated either by contacting other molecules or by intermolecular interactions(collisions).

"The ﬂuorescence of a compound can be affected from the solvent used for the ﬂu-orophore solution. The solvent effect can be observed as a shift of the spectral maxima(solvatochromic shift), as a change of the intensity of the spectral line or band and as achange of the shape and width of the band [26]. By increasing the solvent polarity, shifts ofthe emission spectrum to longer wavelengths (red shifts) are usually observed.The pH parameter affects ﬂuorescence as the structure of a molecule can be alteredby altering the pH. For example, a compound can become a spherical or linear shape indifferent pH values [27]. The ionization of a molecule after pH modiﬁcation may alterthe molecular orbital of the excitable electrons. Furthermore, H+ ions compete with metalions in complexation with dissolved organic matter (DOM) and thus, there are metals thatincrease the ﬂuorescence in water samples [28].Additionally, the effect of temperature is very important. The electrons return to theground state by radiationless processes. By decreasing the temperature from 45 ◦C to10 ◦C, it was found that the intensity of DOM has been increased by 48%. [29].

"Laser induced ﬂuorescence (LIF) is classiﬁed as steady-state (or continuous wave,CW) when only the spectral information of the emission is recorded, or as time-resolvedLIF, where information of the ﬂuorescence lifetime is derived [1]. For CW LIF, wherethe time integrated ﬂuorescence is recorded, both CW and pulsed laser sources can beused. In time-resolved LIF, for the ﬂuorescence analysis in time domain, a pulsed laser isnecessary with pulse duration below ns, while in frequency-domain techniques, an opticalmodulation of CW laser can be used. Most types of lasers can operate in both CW andpulsed mode, while there are few types that in principle cannot be run in CW mode.The LIF spectroscopy can also be categorized according to its spectral operation, asexcitation LIF when selecting the excitation wavelength or as emission LIF when the emittedlight is spectrally analyzed. In excitation LIF spectroscopy, the excitation wavelength isvaried using a tunable laser and each time the total emitted light is detected using a ﬁlter infront of the detector to remove any scattered laser light. In emission LIF spectroscopy, aﬁxed wavelength laser is used to excite the sample and the emission spectrum is measuredby using a monochromator before the detector to scan the wavelength or by using aspectrometer [31].The high intensity light, achieved from focusing the pulsed laser beam, is able to induceﬂuorophore excitation by the simultaneous absorption of two or more photons of lowerenergy (longer wavelength) [32]. Multiphoton excitation has a rather small probability,as it depends non-linearly to the light intensity (photon ﬂuence) and becomes efﬁcientonly in the region of the focal spot. For the two-photon absorption, there is quadraticdependence on laser intensity. The excitation photons originate from one laser beam or bydifferent laser sources. The two-photon absorption spectrum may differ in shape from theone-photon spectrum, as there are different selection rules applied for them that allow orprohibit speciﬁc transitions [33]. The two-photon absorption laser induced ﬂuorescence(TALIF) spectroscopy could be complementary to the conventional LIF capable of revealingenergy states not accessible from one-photon transition, to excites in UV range using laserof double wavelengths that are more easily available to clearly separate the excitation laserwavelength from the detected emitted light.LIF spectroscopy is often combined with the laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy(LIBS) as an emerging analytical technique for the elemental analysis of various samples [34].In LIBS, the sample is irradiated by a high-power pulsed laser to generate localized plasmaand breakdown the material into excited ionic and atomic species, whose emission is thenspectroscopically analyzed. By utilizing a second laser beam tuned to selectively excite theplasma species, a great enhancement of their emission capability is achieved [35].",9.98,False,6,165.97500610351562,311.3023681640625,False,False,False,body

"The ﬂuorescence signals could be recorded in several ways. In emission LIF spec-troscopy, the intensity for each wavelength of the emitted light is recorded for a ﬁxedexcitation wavelength to derive the ﬂuorescence emission spectrum. In excitation LIF spec-troscopy, the intensity of the total light emitted is recorded whilst scanning the excitationwavelength to derive the ﬂuorescence excitation spectrum.There are other sophisticated methods of conventional ﬂuorescence spectroscopythat also apply in LIF, such as the synchronous ﬂuorescence spectroscopy (SFS), the totalsynchronous ﬂuorescence spectroscopy (TSFS) and the excitation-emission matrix (EEM). InSFS, the emission spectrum is recorded while both the excitation and emission wavelengthsare scanned simultaneously but maintaining a constant difference (offset) between them∆λ [36]. Synchronous spectra provide more information compared to a single scan. InTSFS, the output result is a contour map that contains numerous synchronous spectraat different offsets. Finally, the EEM method that was introduced in 1977 [37,38] resultsin a three-dimensional (3D) plot of ﬂuorescence excitation wavelength versus emissionwavelength and intensity. It provides full detailed information that can be used to identifyseveral ﬂuorophores present in complex mixtures. They are easy distinguished because themaximum ﬂuorescence intensity for each of them is resulted only from one pair of λex/λemin the matrix.Furthermore, for quantitative measurements, the data from recording spectra need tobe quantiﬁed. For this purpose, many standard ﬂuorescence indices have been developedand are deﬁned as the ratios of emission intensity at two different points or areas [39]. Thedata obtained from EEM are often reduced with statistical methods, with parallel factoranalysis (PARAFAC) be the most popular discriminant analysis.",9.85,False,7,165.97500610351562,113.14537811279297,False,False,False,body

"Scattering is a major problem encountered in ﬂuorescence measurements. There aretwo types of scattering: the Raman (inelastic) and the Rayleigh (elastic) scattering. Rayleighscattering occurs when there are molecules of smaller size than the wavelength of theexcitation light, while the scattered light has the same wavelength. It is easily ﬁltered outfrom the longer wavelengths of emission. The Rayleigh scatter in EEM appears as a visiblediagonal line at the emission wavelength equal to the excitation wavelength, while forthe second order of Rayleigh scatter, the bright line appears at the emission wavelengthequal to double the excitation wavelength. Raman scatter happens because the light isabsorbed and re-emitted with loss in photon energy. The loss is due to the vibrational statesand the scattered light having a higher wavelength than the excitation light. Water hasscattering properties from the vibration of O-H bonds, and in aqueous samples the Ramanline appears in EEM as a diagonal line at excitation wavelengths from 260 to 350 nm and atemission wavelengths from 280 to 400 nm.The inner ﬁltering effect (IFE) is another phenomenon that affects the recorded ﬂuo-rescence. The excitation IFE occurs because a part of the incident light is absorbed fromthe ﬂuorophore before reaching the sample area form where the ﬂuorescence emission iscollected in. Therefore, when increasing the ﬂuorophore concentration, the ﬂuorescenceintensity increases up to a certain point and then starts to decrease. Moreover, the emissionof IFE is caused by the self-absorption of the emitted light by the ﬂuorophore before itreaches the detector. This results in a reduction of the recorded spectrum, where the ab-sorption overlaps with the emission which changes the shape of the recorded spectrumin the low wavelength portion. Additionally, IFE could be induced due to presence ofother chromophores that absorb the excitation or the emission light. In most environmentalsamples, the main reason for the IFE is the naturally dissolved humic material [40]. TheIFE problem is compensated by reducing the path length in the sample for the excitationor/and emission light and by diluting the water samples to have an absorbance of less than0.1 at 254 nm [41].",9.99,False,7,166.3939971923828,427.30029296875,False,False,False,body

"The detection of target pollutants in liquid and solid environmental samples hasbeen extensively implemented by chromatographic methods coupled with ﬂuorescencedetectors. Fluorescence detectors are of high selectivity as there are few compounds thatﬂuoresce. They are also of higher sensitivity (10–1000 times) compared to diode arrayUV detectors. A tremendous number of publications are dedicated to the determina-tion of pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in water [42–44], insoils [45,46], in sediments [47,48], in pesticides in water [49,50], in soil [51,52], in pharmaceu-ticals in water [53,54], in soils [55,56], in sediments [57,58] and in metals in water [59,60] bychromatographic techniques coupled with ﬂuorescence detectors. In all publications, a pre-concentration of the samples is required, as the pollutants exist in very low concentrations.The preconcentration can be achieved by liquid–liquid extraction, solid phase extractionor solid phase microextraction for aqueous samples. For the solid samples such as soilsand sediments, solid-liquid extraction and fractionation according to pH have usuallybeen applied. Besides, ﬂuorescence has been used for the direct characterization of qualityof environmental samples without preconcentration. The applications of ﬂuorescence inenvironmental samples without preconcentration are described as follows.",9.95,False,8,166.0850067138672,113.14537811279297,False,False,False,body

"Without any sample preconcentration and/or pretreatment (except ﬁltration if nec-essary), conventional ﬂuorescence has revealed useful information about the water andwastewater quality. The majority of studies have focused on the dissolved organic matter(DOM), which is the major water constituent, while less have focused on oil pollution.The ﬁrst signiﬁcant studies were those of Coble [61,62] that have characterized ma-rine and terrestrial DOM in seawater by EEM ﬂuorescence spectroscopy. The peaks wereclassiﬁed into ﬁve categories and named as A, B, C, T and M. Both peaks A and C were ofhumic-like ﬂuorescence, with peak A irradiated by UV excitation and peak C by visible ex-citation. Peaks B and T were of tyrosine-like and tryptophan-like ﬂuorescence, respectively.Peak M was speciﬁc for marine humic-like ﬂuorescence.The distinguishment between surface water from eastern (Atlantic and modiﬁed polarwater) and western (Canada-basin polar water) Arctic sectors was detected by using EEMﬂuorescence spectroscopy [63]. In this work, the Eurasian polar water showed highervisible DOM ﬂuorescence signals than the water from the Canada basin.The characterization and monitoring of wastewater in surface waters has been achievedby EEM ﬂuorescence spectroscopy [64]. The peaks T (living and dead cellular material andtheir exudates) and C (microbially reprocessed organic matter) from wastewater samplespresented much higher intensity compared with those from natural waters. Furthermore,peak T ﬂuorescence was highly reduced after the biological treatment process, while peakC was almost completely removed after the chlorination and reverse osmosis processes.Another application of EEM coupled with principal component analysis and secondderivative analysis has characterized wastewater samples after each treatment process in amunicipal wastewater plant [65]. Figure 3 shows an example of a wastewater sample afteranaerobic treatment.Another work [66] has used EEMs to distinguish the origin and the distribution ofDOM in different water samples such as oligotrophic oceanic waters, reef waters, riverwaters and groundwater. The ﬂuorophores that were identiﬁed within the samples were:humic-like A, humic-like C, marine humic-like M, tryptophan-like T1 and T2 and tyrosine-like B1 and B2. Some unknown peaks (U1 and U2) have also been identiﬁed.Huang [67] identiﬁed six ﬂuorophores by EEC-PARAFAC in the eutrophicated lakeTaihu during autumn. They were named A, B, C, N, M and T. The results showed that redshift happened with increasing ﬂuorescence intensity for peaks A (UV humic-like) and C(terrestrial humic-like) while peak M had the reverse red shift. From another survey in thesame lake, only four ﬂuorophores were detected during one month [68] by EEC-PARAFAC.",9.97,False,8,165.97500610351562,339.39739990234375,False,False,False,body

"Goslan [69] studied the seasonal change of DOM and its effect on the treatmentprocesses by EEM and by synchronous ﬂuorescence. At least two ﬂuorophores wereidentiﬁed in non-fractionated and fractionated (acids, bases, neutrals) water samples. Thefractionation of samples was performed by resin according to their hydrophobicity.In rainwater samples [70], three ﬂuorophores were identiﬁed by EEM: humic-likeC, tyrosine-like B and tryptophan-like T. In addition, the results show that humic-likeﬂuorescence was strongly inﬂuenced by terrestrial/anthropogenic sources, while tyrosineand tryptophane-like ﬂuorescence was not inﬂuenced from the meteorological variables.Synchronized ﬂuorescence by a conventional spectroﬂuorometer at ∆λ = 30 nm be-tween emission and excitation wavelengths was applied in an estuary located in northeastBrazil [71]. Four peaks were identiﬁed at wavelengths 278–280 nm (peak I), 350 nm (peakII), 385 nm (peak III) and 458–460 nm (peak IV). Peak I was due to microbial productionwhile peaks II, III and IV were related to humic and fulvic acids.Generally, the main fluorophores and their positions as identified by most researchers [62,72]in various types of water are summarized in Table 2.Other researchers [73] have studied the oil dispersion in seawater by recording theemission spectra. They found that the intensity at 445 nm is indicative of higher molecularweight PAHs without having to measure the oil concentration.The concentrations of three PAHs were predicted by EEM-PARAFAC in urban run-offsfrom asphalt paved roads [74].

"Uebel [75] applied the LIF method in order to detect water pollutants and their possibleinteractions with phytoplankton and break-down products (yellow-substances) in situ.They used a frequency doubled dye laser as an excitation source with a pulse energyof 10 mJ and a pulse duration of 10 ns. The substances were excited in the range from265 nm to 400 nm while the ﬂuorescence signal was recorded in the range of 310 nm–750 nm.Different ﬂuorescence spectra appeared during ageing and dying of the phytoplankton.For the detection of PAHs and oils in groundwater, Baumann [76] chose a nitrogenlaser and time-resolved LIF based on the different decay times of humic substances andPAHs. They calculated the concentrations of 16 PAHs and found a good correlation withthe results obtained by HPLC coupled with a ﬂuorescence detector.In a work of Sivaprakasam and Killinger [77], two different LIF instruments weretested for the determination of DOC and quinine sulfate in natural water samples, bottleddistilled and bottled drinking water samples, where it was found that plastic-relatedcompounds were leached into the water from the containers. One instrument utilizes aUV tunable dye laser (200–285 nm, 0.2–5 µJ, 10 Hz) with a spectrometer and CCD detector,while the other one is a portable system utilizing a ﬁxed wavelength microchip laser (at266 nm, 1 µJ, 8 KHz) with a gated PMT detector and bandpass interference ﬁlters. Althoughboth systems use laser pulses of the same energy, the higher repetition rate in the lattersystem provides a much greater signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) measurements due to the highpulse averaging and the higher total energy output. In conjunction with the detectionsystem, it was found to have a 10 times higher sensitivity than the ﬁrst system, but withmuch slower processing time to obtain a full emission spectrum. It was found to have upto 100 times higher sensitivity from the best commercial portable spectroﬂuorometer, whileit was tested in situ for the determination of plastics and DOC in seawater samples [78].Additionally, they upgraded it to have two interchangeable microchip lasers operating at266 nm and 355 nm, achieving the tracking of DOC in the clean ocean water by continuouslyoperating the portable LIF system for ﬁve days [79].The same portable LIF unit was tested to measure the ﬂuorescence from tap water andsea water after being treated by reverse osmosis [80] and in ground and drinking watersamples [81]. It was found that the deeper UV laser showed more distinct spectra withquantitative features and gave better separation of the LIF from the Raman peak allowingthe detection of unique spectral features. Most of the LIF systems utilize laser sources indeep UV.Ghervase et al. [82] have chosen the fourth harmonic output of an Nd:YAG laser forthe excitation of both microbial and humic-like substances due to the high energy of theexcitation photons (266 nm). They detected the impact from human and chicken waste inrivers and found that chicken waste had a speciﬁc ﬂuorescence signature.LIF and excitation-emission matrix (EEM) ﬂuorescence were applied in river samplesfrom the lower basin of the Arges River. They detected urban sewage contamination bypicking up ﬂuorescence signals, such as that from tyrosine and the presence of folded andunfolded tryptophan residues [83].Recently, Du et al. [84] have used a UV laser at 266 nm in order to detect the presenceof three aromatic amino acids in seawater (tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine) in situ.The peaks of tryptophan, tyrosine and phenylalanine were detected at 350, 300 and 280 nm,respectively, as shown in Figure 4, and their concentrations were quantiﬁed.In a recent work [85] a small-sized spectroﬂuorometer operated at 278 nm was usedfor the identiﬁcation of oil products in seawater. They found that the spectral features werechanged depending on the state of the oil product.A combination of LIBS and LIF was used in order to detect trace amounts of heavymetals in water samples. Speciﬁcally, lead was detected by using a Q-switched Nd:YAGlaser to produce plasma, at 1064 nm or 532 nm [86].

The applicationof LIF was performed on unfractionated soil samples, fractionated with chemical methodsand fractionated by physical methods (particle size). The results indicate that every particlesize fraction showed a different shape, revealing differences in organic compounds boundedto them.

"LIF has the great advantage of being expended to the outdoor environment. It is atechnique that can also be applied as remote sensing and, hence, it is called laser remotesensing system LIDAR (light detection and ranging). It makes it possible to analyzecompounds from long distances and it can operate under full sunlight.There are many studies about LIDAR systems for the measurements of hydrographicparameters and substances in water. Nunes [109] has used a LIDAR using the 2nd harmonicof Nd: YAG laser system with a pulse energy of 200 mJ, a duration of 10 ns and a repetitionrate of 10 Hz to measure chlorophyll a (685 nm) and DOM (from 540 to 620 nm) in deep seawater. Babichenko [110] has used a LIDAR Nd: YAG laser at 355 nm and a four-channeldetector (355, 403, 450 and 680 nm) in order to measure chlorophyll a and other pigmentsin the subsurface water layer.Other researchers have used the laser beam of an excimer (308 nm) and of a tunabledye laser (367 and 460 nm) to measure dissolved organic matter (DOM), chlorophyll a andother pigments in the Black Sea [111,112] and in the Danube Delta [113].The disadvantages of excimer lasers are their high purchase and maintenance costsand the continuous need for gas supply compared with the solid state Nd:YAG lasers [114].To the best of our knowledge, there are not any applications of LIDAR for monitoringsoil quality.

"The present study reveals the beneﬁts of the application of ﬂuorescence spectroscopyto environmental samples in order to assess their quality. Fluorescence can be achievedby the excitation of the compounds either by lamps or by lasers. In the ﬁrst occasion, itis considered as conventional ﬂuorescence, while in the second it is called laser inducedﬂuorescence (LIF). Both of them have been applied mainly for the characterization of DOMin various types of water, soil and sediment samples. In a lesser extent, they have beenapplied for the detection of pollutants such as oil products in these samples.In conventional ﬂuorescence spectroscopy, the most common lamps are Xe and Hg.The most use recording technique in conventional ﬂuorescence is EEM combined withPARAFAC analysis. It has been applied mainly for the characterization of DOM in varioustypes of water. For the majority of the studies, the results from EEM showed the presenceof peaks that have been categorized in ﬁve categories. The application of conventionalspectroscopy in soil and sediment samples after pretreatment for isolation has led to thecategorization of the same ﬂuorophores.",10.0,False,13,166.0850067138672,597.847412109375,False,False,False,body

"In LIF spectroscopy, the common light source is the solid state laser Nd:YAG, as it wasfound to be more suitable for the detection of DOC and pollutants, followed by dye lasersthat offer excitation tunability for the recording the ﬂuorescence intensity versus emissionwavelength. LIF has been applied less than conventional spectroscopy, especially in soilsamples, although no sample pretreatment was necessary. Furthermore, LIF has been usedfor remote sensing measurements of various water systems by excimer and dye lasers.LIF has proven to be a powerful tool for assessing the environmental quality and its useis continuously extending. Lasers have the advantages of high sensitivity and selectivity,as well as being versatile sources. Furthermore, the problem of quenching is minimizedbecause laser sources have very high intensities compared with the potential quenching. Thedisadvantage is the restriction in excitation tunability that makes it difficult to record the EEMin order to gain more information about the complexity of the environmental samples.",9.96,False,14,165.97500610351562,97.746337890625,False,False,False,body
