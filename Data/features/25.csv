"Abstract: Infrared detection technology plays an important role in remote sensing, imaging, mon-itoring, and other ﬁelds. So far, most infrared photodetectors are based on InGaAs and HgCdTematerials, which are limited by high fabrication costs, complex production processes, and poorcompatibility with silicon-based readout integrated circuits. This hinders the wider application ofinfrared detection technology. Therefore, reducing the cost of high-performance photodetectors is aresearch focus. Colloidal quantum dot photodetectors have the advantages of solution processing,low cost, and good compatibility with silicon-based substrates.

"Infrared photoelectric technologies use infrared materials to convert infrared radiationenergy into electrical signals. Infrared photodetectors are widely used in autonomousdriving, machine vision, security surveillance, and other ﬁelds [1–5]. In recent years, withthe continuous development of infrared detection technology, more and more infraredphotodetectors have been developed. Currently, the mainstream infrared photodetectorsare mainly based on narrow-gap semiconductors such as InGaAs [6,7], HgCdTe [8–10], andother materials, which have high sensitivity, wide-band detection capabilities, long-timestability, and good reliability [11]. However, they still have problems such as high cost,a complex epitaxial growth process, and poor compatibility with silicon-based readoutintegrated circuit chips [12–14], limiting their wider application.The emergence of colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) provides a feasible way for thedevelopment of infrared photodetectors. As a new type of photoelectric material, CQDshave the advantages of a wide spectral tuning range, low cost of preparation by thermalinjection, and solution processing [15–17], and CQDs have great application potential inmany practical applications. In addition, CQDs can be directly integrated with silicon-basedreadout integrated circuits through solution processing, which reduces the fabrication costand difﬁculty [18,19]. As a result, CQD infrared detectors have been a research hotspot inrecent years. Among CQD infrared detectors [20], lead-based [21] CQD photodetectorshave been demonstrated to have high sensitivity and response speed. Lead-based CQDsinclude PbTe, PbSe, and PbS CQDs. Their detection bands are mainly in the near-infraredand visible light range. Among them, PbSe and PbS CQDs have already been applied tolarge-array readout integrated circuits [22]. However, lead-based CQDs have the problemsof easy oxidation and interference from humidity in the air [23].",9.98,False,1,166.09500122070312,485.6313171386719,False,False,False,body

"Lead-based CQDs have received signiﬁcant attention in recent years due to theirunique optical and electronic properties. PbX (Te, Se, S) possess a cubic crystal latticestructure [24–26] and are narrow-band-gap semiconductors with 0.32 eV, 0.28 eV, and0.41 eV, respectively. As a result, PbX (Te, Se, S) CQDs exhibit size-tunable infrared bandgaps from visible to infrared. Beneﬁtting from mature chemical synthesis technology,they are attractive for a wide range of applications, including infrared photodetectors,photovoltaics, and thermoelectric devices. PbTe CQDs, in particular, possess a large excitonBohr radius (46 nm) [27], a high dielectric constant (1000) [28], and a high multiexcitongeneration yield.In 1995, Reynoso et al. ﬁrst grew PbTe CQDs in doped glass, and the absorptionwavelength could be adjusted at 1.1–2.0 µm by changing the heat time and temperature [29].The application potential of PbTe CQDs in optoelectronic devices was demonstrated. In2006, Murphy et al. reported a synthesis method for spherical and cubic PbTe CQDs [30],whose size distribution could reach 7%, and the diameter of synthesized CQDs ranged from2.6 to 18 nm. The ﬁrst exciton transition was achieved from 1009 to 2054 nm (Figure 1a).The photoluminescence quantum yield of spherical PbTe CQDs was as high as 52 ± 2%.In the same year, Urban et al. synthesized monodispersed PbTe CQDs [31] with obviousadvantages in size tunability and solution processability compared to the early CQDs inglass (Figure 1b). In addition, the conductivity of the PbTe CQDs ﬁlm could be increasedby 9–10 orders of magnitude through chemical treatment. Therefore, PbTe CQDs wereexpected to be applied in photodetectors.Aiming at the problem of PbTe CQDs’ susceptibility to oxidation, in 2009, Lambert et al.proposed a core–shell structure of PbTe/CdTe [32]. The CdTe shell was grown around PbTeusing the cation exchange method (Figure 1c). It was observed that PbTe and CdTe had thesame lattice orientation, achieving seamless matching. This method effectively resolved theoxidation problem of PbTe CQDs, but it had an anisotropy problem in the exchange process.To improve the method for the synthesis of PbTe CQDs, in 2012, Pan et al. proposed asynthesis method for monodisperse hydrophobic PbTe CQDs [27]. Using oleylamine as thecapping ligand and solvent allowed the hydrophobic PbTe CQDs to be easily transformedinto CQDs with different ligands. The application of PbTe CQDs in biomedicine waspossible. PbTe CQDs could be changed from hydrophobic to hydrophilic through ligandexchange with 4-mercaptopyridine. In addition, the synthesized PbTe CQDs were found tobe air-stable.To enhance the photoluminescence (PL) performance of PbTe CQDs, Protesescu et al.reported the PL properties of core–shell PbTe/CdTe CQDs in 2016 [33]. PbTe/CdTe CQDswere demonstrated to have stable near-infrared emission within the 1–3 µm range. Duringthe cation exchange process, with the addition of excess cadmium oleate, Cd could replacePb to shrink the PbTe core, resulting in a shift of the PL peak to a shorter wavelength(Figure 1d). Compared with pure PbTe CQDs, the PL stability of PbTe/CdTe CQDs wassigniﬁcantly improved, even in ambient air.In 2019, Peters et al. studied the fundamental chemistry of PbTe CQDs [34]. Therelationship between the band gap and the NC diameter was measured, and the resultsshowed that the energy absorbed by the primary optical absorption had a 1/d relationshipwith the diameter of the CQDs. And the connection mode of surface ligand oleic acid andPbTe CQDs was mostly chelating bidentate coordination. In 2020, Miranti et al. proposed",9.99,False,2,165.97500610351562,211.77537536621094,False,False,False,body

Enhancing n-type transport made core–shell PbTe/PbS promising for applicationsin the thermoelectric and electron transport layers of photovoltaic devices.PbTe CQDs are highly sensitive to oxygen. Modifying the surface of PbTe CQDsor using other CQDs to wrap PbTe CQDs could be considered in future development toprevent the interference of external oxygen.

"By acquiring a deeper understanding of the coordination chemistry between oleic acidand PbTe CQDs, we can further optimize the synthesis and properties of PbTe CQDs.This endeavor will lay a robust foundation for their development in future electronic andoptoelectronic devices.The weak binding energy of PbTe CQDs, easy oxidation in air, and low photocon-ductivity limited their application in photodetectors. In 2016, Lin et al. proposed a PbTeCQD photodetector treated with tetrabutylammonium iodine (TBAI) [36] (Figure 2a,b).The TABI ligand exchange effectively passivated the surface of PbTe CQDs, reducing theaverage spacing between CQDs from 4.2 nm to 2.3 nm. As a result, the TABI-treatedPbTe CQDs ﬁlm transformed from a nonlinear Schottky contact to a symmetrical Ohmiccontact. The maximum responsivity of the device could reach 1.9 mA/W. Under 150 Hzlaser irradiation, the response time of the device reached 0.39 ms and the recovery timereached 0.49 ms, which effectively improved the response speed of the device (Figure 2c,d).Moreover, the detector with TBAI-treated PbTe CQDs had a stable photoresponse in airdue to the protective effect of the upper polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) layer.",10.01,False,4,166.0850067138672,97.60338592529297,False,False,False,body

Further study of the devices under a limited magnetic ﬁeldshowed that PbTe CQDs exhibit a strong Rashba spin–orbit interaction.The application of PbTe CQD photodetectors had been limited due to the issue ofeasy oxidation. To overcome this challenge, the investigation of surface ligand exchangefor PbTe CQDs could be considered to protect CQDs from oxidation and enhance theirstability. Alongside ligand exchange, exploring other surface passivation strategies wasalso important. This included the utilization of inorganic passivation materials such asmetal oxides and chalcogenides, as well as the development of hybrid passivation methodscombining organic and inorganic materials. The study of surface passivation strategiesfor PbTe CQDs plays a crucial role in improving their stability and enabling their practicalapplication in optoelectronic devices.",10.0,False,5,166.38900756835938,97.60338592529297,False,False,False,body

"PbSe CQDs are a material with strong quantum conﬁnement, having an exciton Bohrradius of 46 nm [38]. This characteristic contributes to stronger electron coupling, whichleads to improved charge carrier transport within the PbSe CQD ﬁlm.In 1997, Lipovskii et al. successfully synthesized size-controllable PbSe CQDs witha size between 2 and 15 nm and a size distribution of about 7% [39]. In 2004, Pietrygaet al. studied the mid-infrared PL properties of PbSe CQDs [40]. The experimental resultsshowed that the synthesized PbSe CQDs had excellent ﬂuorescence tunability and narrowsize distribution (Figure 3a,b). In 2007, Baek et al. synthesized monodisperse PbSe CQDsusing solution chemistry and realized the use of two different ligands of acetic acid (AA)and hexanoic acid (HA) to control the size of CQDs [41] (Figure 3c). The experimentalresults showed that AA and HA could replace part of the oleate on the surface of PbSeCQDs, resulting in a reduction in steric hindrance and a reduction in the average size ofCQDs. To enhance the antioxidant ability of PbSe CQDs, in 2012, Hughes et al. proposed amethod of ligand exchange for PbSe CQDs using alkyl selenides [42] (Figure 3d). Alkylselenides could completely replace the oleic acid ligands on the surface of CQDs. Comparedwith the oleic acid ligand, the combination between the Pb atom on the surface of the alkylselenide ligand and the alkyl selenide ligand was more stable, thereby improving theoxidation resistance of the surface of CQDs.In 2017, Campos et al. proposed a method for the synthesis of PbSe CQDs through N,N, N′-Trisubstituted selenourea precursors [43]. The size of CQDs (1.7–6.6 nm) could bewell regulated, with a narrow size distribution of 0.5–2% and a narrow spectral absorptionpeak (Figure 3e). Experiments had proved that the N, N, N’-Trisubstituted selenourea had aslower and more controllable conversion reaction than the N, N’-Trisubstituted selenoureaand the N, N, N’, N’-tetrame-thylselenourea. The proposal of trisubstituted selenoureaprovided a feasible strategy for other CQDs synthesized from selenium precursors. PbSeCQDs usually required complex and tedious synthesis steps. In 2020, Liu et al. proposeda method for the direct synthesis of PbSe CQDs at room temperature in one step, whichsimpliﬁed the synthesis steps and costs [44] (Figure 3f). The experimental results conﬁrmedthat CQDs had excellent surface passivation ability.",9.95,False,5,165.97500610351562,312.28839111328125,False,False,False,body

"Due to the gradual maturity of PbSe CQD synthesis technology, photodetectors basedon PbSe CQDs were studied.

The PbSe surface was passivated by chemical treatment, whicheffectively reduced the dark current of the device. The performance of the devices underdifferent ligand exchanges was also explored, and the current density of the device treatedwith benzonedthiol (BDT) was 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of the untreateddevice. Treatment with BDT showed a 20-fold increase in hole mobility and an 80-foldincrease in electron mobility. In 2016, Fu et al. enhanced the stability of synthesized PbSeCQDs by ammonium chloride treatment and prepared Au/PbSe/PMMA/Au photode-tectors [46] (Figure 4b).

"To extend the detection band of PbSe CQD photodetectors, in 2019, Zhu et al. proposeda PbSe CQD photodetector with a detection range from the ultraviolet to the mid-infraredregion (350–2500 nm) [47] (Figure 4c,d). The hole-trapping-induced photomultiplicationeffect was realized by p-type EDT (ethanedithiol)-PbSe CQDs and an n-type TABI-PbSeCQDs double-layer ﬁlm. Experimental results showed that the photodetector had a quan-tum efﬁciency of 450% in the visible region and a detectivity of more than 1012 Jones atroom temperature. In the infrared region, the quantum efﬁciency could reach 120% and thedetectivity could reach 4 × 1011 Jones. Such photodetectors provided a feasible way for thedevelopment of uncooled, broadband photodetectors.In order to achieve PbSe CQD compatibility with silicon-based substrates, in 2021,Chen et al. proposed a photodetector using PbSe CQDs in Si, with an infrared spec-tral response range of 450–1550 nm [48] (Figure 4e,f). The device achieved a responsiv-ity of 648.7 A/W and a response time of 32.3 µs at 1550 nm. The detectivity reached7.48 × 1010 Jones, and the external quantum efﬁciency reached 6.47 × 104%. The devicehad the advantages of being low-cost and easy to integrate with silicon-based readout cir-cuits. In the same year, Peng et al. proposed a near-infrared detector using PbSe CQDs [49](Figure 4g,h). PbSe CQDs were created using the method of one-step synthesis at roomtemperature and directly introduced iodide ions, which realized in situ passivation ofiodide ions and avoided redundant ligand exchange processes. The device had a respon-sivity of 970 mA/W and a detectivity of 1.86 × 1011 Jones at 808 nm. Compared with thepure PbSe CQD detector, the photocurrent of the heterojunction detector increased from7.6 × 10−9 A to 7.4 × 10−8 A, and the dark current decreased from 1.3 × 10−9 A to7.7 × 10−11 A, effectively reducing the dark current of the device.Since pure PbSe CQDs were easily oxidized, which led to the degradation of the deviceperformance, the concept of combining PbSe CQDs with other materials had been proposed.A composite material was prepared with materials such as organic polymers and metaloxides, enabling the interaction between different materials to optimize device performance.It provided a novel way to achieve an extended band and improve device stability.In 2015, Wang et al. proposed a near-infrared photodetector with a ﬁeld-effect tran-sistor structure combining PbSe CQDs and poly (3-hexylthiophene-2, 5-diyl) (P3HT) [50](Figure 5a).

"tively. Two-dimensional materials became a research hotspot because of their excellentoptical and electrical properties. Two-dimensional materials have high carrier performance,so combining with CQDs could make up for the shortcomings of CQDs. In this combi-nation, a quantum dot layer is used as a photosensitive material, and a two-dimensionalmaterial can improve the mobility of carriers and other properties. Therefore, devicescombining zero-dimensional and two-dimensional materials could effectively improvethe performance of detectors. In 2019, Luo et al. reported a device combining PbSe CQDsand Bi2O2Se [51] (Figure 5b,c), realizing 2 µm short-wave detection. The responsivity wasgreater than 103 A/W, and the response time could reach 4 ms. High sensitivity and quickresponse were realized. In 2022, Peng et al. reported a photodetector integrated with PbSeCQDs and two-dimensional material MoS2 [52] (Figure 5j). The photo–dark current ratioof the heterogeneous photodetector could reach 102, the maximum responsivity couldreach 23.5 A/W, and the maximum detectivity could reach 3.17 × 1010 Jones under 635 nmillumination. And the detection band of the detector could be extended to the near-infraredregion. Under the illumination of 808 nm, it achieved a responsivity of 19.7 A/W and adetectivity of 2.65 × 1010 Jones.

The responsivity ofthe device was 7.17 A/W and the detectivity was 8.97 × 1012 Jones under 365 nm light and5 V voltage. Response rise and decay times were 0.5 ms and 0.78 ms, respectively. Moreover,the ﬂexible detector could retain 91.2% of its initial performance even after being bentthousands of times. It provided a feasible strategy for the development of ﬂexible devices.In 2022, Sulaman et al. proposed a self-powered broadband photodetector combining PbSeCQDs with CsPbBr1.5I1.5 [54] (Figure 5g–i). The responsivity could reach 6.16 A/W, andthe detectivity could reach 5.96 × 1013 Jones.Due to the excellent electrical and optical properties of PbSe CQDs, in 2021, Dortaj et al.suggested a 10 × 10-pixel high-speed mid-infrared (3–5 µm) camera based on PbSe/PbI2core–shell CQDs [55] (Figure 5k–m). The procedure involved spin-coating PbSe/PbI2 CQDsonto the substrate of interdigitated electrodes, followed by surface passivation with epoxyresin. Subsequently, the imaging results were obtained on the display through the readoutcircuit, as shown in Figure 5l,m. Experimental results showed that the response rise time ofthe detector could reach 100 ns. The camera could achieve 1 million frames per second, sohigh-resolution images were obtained.As a new type of photoelectric conversion device, PbSe CQD photodetectors offerseveral advantages, including fast response, high sensitivity, low cost, and easy preparation.The performance of PbSe CQDs could be further improved by combining them with othermaterials.

"PbS CQDs have a wide tunable band-gap range (0.6–1.6 eV), a high molar broadbandabsorption coefﬁcient (≈106 M−1 cm−1), and a large Bohr exciton radius (~18 nm) [27].These characteristics make PbS CQDs excellent candidates for low-cost broad-spectrumphotodetectors.In 1990, Nenadovic et al. ﬁrst prepared 4 nm PbS CQDs in an aqueous solution [56].In 2011, Lingley et al. proposed a new method of ligand exchange by replacing the oleicacid ligands on the surface of PbS CQDs with nonanoic and dodecanoic acid ligands [57](Figure 6a). And a high quantum efﬁciency (55%) could be maintained. In 2013, Zhang et al.synthesized PbS CQDs with good size distribution using H2S as a sulfur source, and thestability and reproducibility of CQDs prepared by this method were better [58] (Figure 6b).In addition, the long ligand of oleic acid on the surface of PbS CQDs was replaced by ashort ligand (butylamine), which could effectively extend the carrier lifetime. In 2017, Linet al. proposed a liquid-phase ligand exchange method for PbS CQDs, transferring PbSCQDs to the polar solvent DMF for ligand exchange [59] (Figure 6c). The ligand-exchangedPbS CQDs could achieve enhanced mobility and were stable for several months, whichlaid a solid foundation for the development of photodetectors in the future. In the sameyear, to produce stable PbS CQDs, Shestha et al. proposed a method of pre-combiningthiol ligands with Pb2+ before ligand exchange [60], which effectively improved the ligandexchange efﬁciency of PbS CQDs (Figure 6d). Experimental results showed that 78%of the original oleic acid-terminated CQD photoluminescence quantum efﬁciency couldbe maintained after ligand exchange in PbS CQDs by Pb-thiolate. To further study theinﬂuence of reaction conditions on PbS CQDs, in 2020, Shuklov et al. proposed a methodto synthesize 1.7–2.05 µm PbS CQDs through a mixture of oleic acid and oleylamine [61].The experimental study showed that the reaction temperature could signiﬁcantly affectthe size of PbS CQDs, while the reaction time had little effect on the PbS CQDs.

"In this review, we reviewed the development of lead chalcogenide CQD photodetec-tors in recent years. Table 1 summarizes the performance of lead-based CQD photode-tectors. The lead-based CQDs include PbTe, PbSe, and PbS CQDs. One can see that leadchalcogenide CQD photodetectors have developed quickly, developing from single-pixelphotodetectors to large array imagers. However, compared with traditional bulk semi-conductor photodetectors, CQD-based photodetectors still face challenges, such as lowdetectivity and large dark current. There are several challenges that need to be addressed:",10.03,False,15,166.09500122070312,113.1915283203125,False,False,False,body

"(1)CQD surface passivation. CQD have large surface to volume ratio. As a result, theyare overly sensitive to the environment. Surface modiﬁcation with organic or in-organic ligands could improve CQD stability and protect their physical properties.For instance, PbTe CQDs, are susceptible to oxidation, making them less suitable forphotodetector applications. To address the problem of oxidation, surface modiﬁcation",9.97,False,15,166.06500244140625,715.0968627929688,False,False,False,body

"techniques utilizing organic or inorganic ligands can be employed to enhance thestability and photoelectric conversion efﬁciency of PbTe CQDs. This improvement isexpected to enhance the overall photoelectric performance and lifespan of photode-tectors. In addition, the directional assembly of CQDs and the ﬁne regulation of theiroptical properties can be achieved through surface modiﬁcation.(2)Dark current reduction on CQD-based photodetectors. Compared with InGaAsand HgCdTe based photodetectors, CQD-based photodetectors typically suffer thedisadvantage on large dark current. The dark current is usually generated by thesurface defects on the CQDs, which can trap and recombine charges. Additionally,thermal excitation in CQD-based devices can lead to dark current generation. To solvethis problem, reducing the surface defects and band tail regulation should be the key.In addition, transport property improvement would also be useful such as dopingdensity and mobility modiﬁcation.(3)Large array photodetectors. At present, most research focus on single-pixel CQDdetectors. However, in real application, it is usually necessary to use array detectors.Large area array photodetectors can be prepared by nanoimprinting technology andmicro-nano processing technology. There are many technical challenges need tobe solved.(4)Broad band photodetectors. At present, the main research on lead based CQD pho-todetector could only cover near-infrared to short-wave infrared. More researchis necessary to promote the progress on broad band photodetection. For example,combining PbS CQDs with graphene, perovskite, and other materials can achievedetection in the visible and near-infrared bands. Therefore, combining CQDs withother materials achieves the purpose of broad-spectrum detection.",9.99,False,16,166.06500244140625,97.60338592529297,False,False,False,body
