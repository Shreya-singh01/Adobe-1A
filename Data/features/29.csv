"Abstract: Recently, the combination of two-dimensional (2D) materials and perovskites has gainedincreasing attention in optoelectronic applications owing to their excellent optical and electricalcharacteristics. Here, we report a self-driven photodetector consisting of a monolayer graphenesheet and a centimeter-sized CH3NH3PbBr3 single crystal, which was prepared using an optimizedwet transfer method. The photodetector exhibits a short response time of 2/30 µs by virtue of itshigh-quality interface, which greatly enhances electron–hole pair separation in the heterostructureunder illumination. In addition, a responsivity of ~0.9 mA/W and a detectivity over 1010 Jonesare attained at zero bias. This work inspires new methods for preparing large-scale high-qualityperovskite/2D material heterostructures, and provides a new direction for the future enhancement ofperovskite optoelectronics.",8.64,True,1,166.01699829101562,250.8870849609375,False,False,False,body

"Photodetectors are of central importance to various applications, such as militarysurveillance, optical communications, automobiles, environmental detection, and biomed-ical sensing. In recent years, perovskite/two-dimensional (2D) material heterojunctionphotodetectors have become a popular research topic [1–4]. Perovskite materials havedrawn increasing attention over the past decade owing to their excellent optical and elec-tronic properties, such as their high optical absorption coefficient, long carrier lifetime anddiffusion lengths, tunable band gap, and low-cost processing. Meanwhile, since the dis-covery of graphene, the potential of 2D layered materials in optical detection has attractedintense interest due to their distinctive mechanical, optical, and electrical characteristics. Ina perovskite/2D material heterojunction photodetector, the perovskites act as the activelayer, absorbing photons to generate electron–hole pairs. The photoexcited carriers areefficiently separated at the interface of the heterostructure by the built-in electric field [5,6].Benefiting from the high absorption coefficient of perovskites and the high carrier mobilityof graphene, these heterojunction photodetectors could achieve a high photoresponsivity, afast photoresponse, and a large dynamic range [7,8]. The combination of these two kindsof materials promises better performance than 2D-material-only photodetectors, as theatomic-scale thickness of 2D materials significantly restricts their light absorption capacity.The photoresponsivity of perovskite/graphene could exceed hundreds of A/W [9], whichis better than that of pure graphene photodetectors [10] by several orders of magnitudes.Furthermore, compared with perovskite-only photodetectors, the combination of thesetwo materials in the device prevents the direct exposure of perovskites to the environment,leading to better resistance to moisture and oxygen. Therefore, the perovskite/2D materialheterostructure is a good candidate for high-performance photodetectors.Graphene, as a typical 2D material, is promising for building high-performanceperovskite/2D-material heterostructures.Clean, residue-free, and highly conductive",9.98,False,1,166.0850067138672,457.525390625,False,False,False,body

"graphene is highly desirable for promoting interfacial coupling and charge injection for het-erojunction photodetectors. The conventional method of preparing graphene on a desiredsubstrate often requires a growing process (generally, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) ontransition metal substrates) and a subsequent transfer process [11,12]. During the transferprocess, the growth substrate is removed by dissolution in a liquid etchant, bubble delami-nation, or thermal peel-off [13], and then the graphene is transferred to the target substrateby wet or dry transfer method. A supporting layer composed of organic polymers is oftenused to prevent mechanical damage. Wet transfer, as an effective means of constructingheterogeneous structures, has the advantages of simple operation, high efficiency, andsuitability for large-scale transfer. The choice of the supporting layer and the liquid solventduring the wet transfer process has a large influence on the electrical properties, structuralintegrity, and uniformity of the graphene. However, the typical liquid transfer solvent(water) and supporting material (polymethyl methacrylate, PMMA) are not compatiblewith perovskite. Water would induce the degradation of halide perovskites by processesincluding hydration, phase transformation, decomposition, and dissolution [14,15]. Inaddition, PMMA is solvable in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), which is one of the mostcommonly used solutes for the preparation of perovskites. Consequently, a substitutefor the supporting layer or modification of the perovskite preparation method must besought to retain the benefits of the wet transfer method for producing high-quality het-erostructures. Using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and saturated perovskite solution assupporting layer and transfer solvent can overcome the drawbacks of the conventionalwet transfer method when applied to perovskites. By replacing deionized water with asaturated perovskite solution, the degradation of perovskites can be avoided. Similar toPMMA, PDMS is a kind of organic polymer material exhibiting good chemical stability,appropriate mechanical strength, and high transparency, and can be easily prepared usingthe spin-coating technique. More importantly, PDMS is not solvable in DMF and so can becompatibly integrated into perovskite fabrication processes. Through these optimizations,the wet transfer technique could be applied to perovskites, and heterostructures with alarge size and high-quality interfaces can be prepared.Here, we demonstrate a self-driven perovskite/graphene heterostructure photode-tector exhibiting fast responses via an optimized wet transfer method, which can transferlarge-size graphene onto perovskite single crystals. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and satu-rated perovskite solution were used as the supporting layer and transfer solvent. MAPbBr3is used as the light-harvesting material, considering its good crystallinity and excellentphotoelectric conversion capability for visible light. On the heterojunction interface pre-pared by the optimized method, the photodetector exhibits a responsivity of ~0.9 mA/W, adetectivity over 1010 Jones at zero bias, and a fast response speed of 2/30 µs.

The crystal with top and bottom electrodeswas latterly used as the target substrate in the following wet transfer process.The high-quality graphene was transferred to the target substrate through a polymer-assisted wet transfer process. The polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) layer was spin-coatedonto the graphene/copper surface (3000 r/min for 30 s) and baked at 120 ◦C for 5 min.Then, the film was placed into the ammonium persulfate etchant to etch the copper foil.The floating graphene supported by the PDMS layer was picked up with a clean glassslide and washed in deionized water 3 times.

"The optical properties of the perovskite were further examined by measuring thesteady-state photoluminescence (PL) and UV–Vis absorption spectrum. The perovskitesamples used for these optical measurements were grown in the same batch as the oneused for the photodetector. The PL spectrum shown in Figure 2c exhibits a peak centeredat 534 nm (2.32 eV) with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 19 nm, consistent withtypical value of MAPbBr3 single crystal reported before [21,22]. The optical cutoff wave-length was measured at 565 nm from the absorption spectrum (Figure 2d). The absorptioncurve has a single straight decline region, and no significant defect level absorption can beobserved except the normal Urbach tail, indicating that the perovskite is defect-free. Thesecharacteristics are consistent with the direct bandgap nature of MAPbBr3 and indicate goodquality of the crystal. The value of bandgap is 2.22 eV, obtained by the conventional Taucplot [23]. That is, we plotted the (αhν)1/2—hν curve and measured the optical bandgap fromthe intercept of extension line. Since the PL spectrum and UV–Vis absorption spectrum isstrongly related to the band-to-band transition of the semiconductor, these results indicatea detection wavelength limit at about 530~560 nm of the perovskites.Raman measurements were performed using a 532 nm excitation laser source in air.As shown in Figure 2e, the G band and the 2D band of graphene appear at 1587 cm−1 and2684 cm−1, respectively.

Low dark currents of−1.21 µA and 14.6 µA were acquired at the voltages of −10 V and +10 V, respectively, and arectification factor of ~12 can be calculated. The device presents conspicuous light response,as the photocurrent increases with the illumination power. Under the illumination witha light density of 77.1 µW/cm2, the photocurrents at the voltage of −10 V and +10 Vwere recorded to be 2.37 µA and 34.9 µA, respectively, resulting in a rectification factor of~15. Under the illumination with a light density of 18 mW/cm2, the photocurrents atthe voltage of −10 V and +10 V were recorded to be 10.8 µA and 438 µA, respectively,resulting in a rectification factor of ~40. The rectification factor becomes larger as theincident light raises. Figure 3c–e are the temporal responses of the photocurrent underswitching illumination at fixed applied voltage of 0 V, −4 V, and −10 V. The device exhibitsgood and stable ON–OFF switching behavior over multiple cycles. It is to be observed thata photocurrent of microampere level exists at zero bias. Therefore, the photodetector canoperate without an external driving voltage. In other words, this self-driven photodetectorcan detect illumination signal without additional energy consumption. The maximumphotocurrent at zero bias in our test was 0.5 µA, obtained when the light intensity was18 mW/cm2, and the maximum photocurrent at −10 V was 14 µA under illumination ofthe same power.",9.88,False,6,165.18800354003906,89.67594146728516,False,False,False,body

The work function of graphene isabout 4.6 eV [26], and the work function of MAPbBr3 crystal is about 4.9 eV [27,28]. Oncethe perovskite and graphene are in contact, electrons in perovskite will flow to the grapheneside, leaving the fixed positive ions to form a depleted space charge area. Thus, the energybands of perovskite bend upward and create a Schottky barrier. This is well consistent withthe rectifying I–V curve of the device. The concentration gradient drives electrons diffusingto the graphene side, while the built-in electric field generated by the space charge driveselectrons to the perovskite side.

When the bias voltage increases, the carrier collection efficiency increases,resulting in a rise of photocurrent.

"Almost all of the carriers generated by the incident light are sufficiently collected at theelectrodes, and so the responsivity is only dependent on the light power density. Asshown in Figure 4c, the responsivity increases as the light density decreases. This trendhappened because a reduced light lowers the carrier concentration and the electron–holerecombination rate in the active layer [11]. The device reaches a highest responsivity valueamong our tests of ~0.9 mA/W at zero bias and ~20.2 mA/W at −10 V bias when the lightdensity is 77.1 µW/cm2. This photoresponsivity is significantly superior to graphene-onlyphotodetectors, which exhibit a photoresponsivity of 0.5 mA/W at a high bias voltage of80 V [10]. When applying positive bias, the responsivity is much larger and exceeds avalue of 0.73 A/W at +10 V bias and the same light density. However, the response time atpositive bias is much slower than that at negative bias, which limits its applicability.The detectivity (D*) of the device can be calculated by using the following equation:",9.9,False,8,166.0050048828125,89.63335418701172,False,False,False,body

As shown in Figure 4d, the detectivity of the photodetectoris about 109~1011 Jones among our tests and decreases as the light power increases. A valueof about 4 × 1010 Jones can be obtained at zero bias for the light density of 77.1 µW/cm2,and the detectivity always exceeds 1010 Jones under the illumination power density of77.1 µW/cm2, which is comparable with existing works [9,30].The photo-switching behaviors of the photodetector are further studied by the experi-ment apparatus illustrated in Figure 5a. A signal generator arises periodic square wavesignal, controlling a 405 nm light emitting diode (LED) to produce alternating light source.The photoresponse of the device is recorded by an oscilloscope. As shown in Figure 5b, thedevice exhibits repeatable and stable photoresponse under the high-frequency alternatingillumination. The rise time (defined as the time for the signal to rise from 10% to 90% whenlight starts to shine) and decay time (defined as the time for the signal to fall from 90% to10% when turning off the light) are measured under 5 kHz (Figure 5c), and the results are2 µs and 30 µs, respectively, as shown in Figure 5c. For comparison, we also prepared aphotodetector based on MAPbBr3 without graphene, which exhibits a response time inmillisecond scale (Figure S3 in Supplementary Material). It is clear that the heterostructuredevice has a faster response time, which is mainly caused by the following: (1) the built-in electric field of the perovskite/graphene heterostructure facilitates the separation ofelectron–hole pairs and the transfer of charges; (2) the high mobility of graphene shortensthe drift time of carriers to reach the electrode. In addition, the response time of our pho-todetector is shorter than other existing similar works, as shown in Table 1, which is mainlydue to the good interface quality of the heterostructure brought about by the optimized wettransfer method.

However, theresponse times of these photodetectors are relatively large. It can be seen that the self-driven heterojunction photodetector we prepared has an ultra-short response time. Thisperformance should mainly be attributed to the optimized wet transfer method whichresults in a high-quality heterojunction interface, since the response time primarily dependson the recombination rate at the interface. The photoresponsivity of our detector is betterthan that of the graphene-only photodetector but is relatively low compared with otherexisting perovskite/graphene heterojunction photodetectors, as shown in Table 1.
