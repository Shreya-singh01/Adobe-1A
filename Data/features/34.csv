"ABSTRACTHuman health/socioeconomic development is closely correlated to environmental pollution, highlighting the need to monitor contaminants in the real environment with reliable devices such as biosensors. Recently, variety of biosensors gained high attention and employed as in-situ application, in real-time, and cost-effective analytical tools for healthy environment. For continuous environmental monitoring, it is necessary for portable, cost-effective, quick, and flexible biosensing devices. These benefits of the biosensor strategy are related to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) established by the United Nations (UN), especially with reference to clean water and sources of energy. However, the relationship between SDGs and biosensor application for environmental monitoring is not well understood. In addition, some limitations and challenges might hinder the biosensor application on environmental monitoring. Herein, we reviewed the different types of biosensors, principle and applications, and their correlation with SDG 6, 12, 13, 14, and 15 as a reference for related authorities and administrators to consider. In this review, biosensors for different pollutants such as heavy metals and organics were documented. The present study highlights the application of biosensor for achieving SDGs.

"Detection and monitoring of pollutants in the envir­onment is crucial for assessing the harmful effects of potential toxicants to people, flora, and fauna [1–3]. Chemical analysis using instruments such as high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) has been tradi­tionally used for monitoring environmental water or soil samples for their sensitivity and accuracy [4]. To further understand the bioavailability of environmen­tal pollutants, biosensors using biological sensor to detect such pollutants have been invented, and they have features of low-cost, energy-saving, and feasibil­ity for real-time in situ monitoring [4,5]. Different types of biosensors were successfully applied for spe­cific or nonspecific detection of heavy metals [6,7] and organic pollutants [1,8]. In groundwater and river water samples, the bioavailable and toxic fractions of metals and organic pollutants such as Cd and toluene could be successfully evaluated using biosensors [9,10]. Moreover, bioavailability of the pollutants such as Hg and phenanthrene was revealed by the use of biosensors [11,12], suggesting the useful appli­cation of biosensors on bioavailability assessment of pollutants in the environmental samples.",11.5,False,2,51.024658203125,289.95660400390625,False,False,False,body
"Biosensor is an analytical strategy for pollutants based on biotechnology, and consists of elements for signal transducer producing detectable or quantifiable signals when sensing pollutants [6,13].

"bioavailability and toxic effects can be established by whole-cell-based biosensor compared with a cell-free one [14,15]. For example, microorganisms possess various responsive mechanisms to cope with environ­mental stress, organic pollutants, and heavy metals, which are associated with different regulatory genes and proteins. The Cd detecting protein cadC regulator could be used in biosensor for Cd detection [16]. In addition, the benzene metabolizing regulatory protein would be useful in recognizing benzene-like organic pollutants [17]. Those regulatory systems interacting with environmental pollutants are the key factors for distinguishing specific pollutants from others [16,17]. However, pollutants with similar structure might hamper the selectivity of biosensors, such as the ben­zene regulatory protein targeting toluene, ethylben­zene, toluene, and xylene [17]. Therefore, the choice of regulatory systems or recognizing elements would greatly affect the selectivity of specific biosensors. Currently, biosensors targeting heavy metals, pesti­cides, or pharmaceuticals show the advantages of bio­sensor such as portability, ease of use, and saving time [18,19]. Recent studies have highlighted the advances made in sensitivity, stability, selectivity, and their con­tribution to environmental monitoring [1,8].",11.5,False,2,306.02581787109375,66.24984741210938,False,False,False,body
"It has been shown that in clinical laboratories, the consumption of electricity, water, and gas as well as the waste produced are the key factors generating large carbon footprints [20]. Energy use was also the major contributor to greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions [21,22]. It is suggested that potential carbon reduction could be achieved by partially using biosensors in pol­lutants analysis due to their low energy requirements. One review has suggested that the contribution of using biosensor for human health on SDGs [23]. However, discussions about the application of biosensor on envir­onmental monitoring and its relationship between sus­tainable development goals (SDGs) are scarce. Biosensors technology is anticipated to be powerful tool for monitoring the environmental pollutants for its advantages on sustainable development. In this arti­cle, different types of biosensors, principles of biosensor construction as well as the application and performance are reviewed.

Other operons such as nah, alkBAC, and DntR were applied in a specific cell-based biosensor for naphthalene, linear alkanes, and pesticides [46–49]. For heavy metals, the sensing elements of specific cell-based biosensor belong to resistance genes instead of metabolized genes, which are located in the plas­mid in microorganisms that could survive in toxic metal-rich environments [50]. Expression of the resistance genes including redox transfor­mation, active transport, and intracellular/extra­cellular precipitation is regulated by intracellular metal level [51]. Both toxic metals and excessive essential metals could trigger the response of resistance or detoxification genes [52,53]. The arsR or arsD in ars operon for arsenic [14], the cadC/A in cad operon for cadmium [54], the merR in mer operon for mercury [6], and the chrB in chr operon for chromium were used in specific cell-based biosensors [55]. Cell-based biosensors for cadmium and mercury were able to detect other metal ions, such as copper, zinc, or lead, which reduces their selectivity [6,54]. zntA and copA promoter/operator evaluated the bioavailability of Zn and Cu [56]. zntA accounts for the removal of intracellular Zn and responds to Cd and Pb [57,58]. copA is responsible for the concentration of Cu and Ag in cells [59]. Regulatory proteins of zntA and copA belong to the MerR homologue, thereby making them responsible for Hg [60,61]. The cnrYXH gene was used to detect the bioavailability of Co and Ni in soil [62].

The Microtox test has been devised using the bacterium Vibrio fischeri whose bioluminescence would dimin­ish due to the toxicity and disrupted metabolism [64,65]. The mechanisms of bioluminescence-based inhibitory biosensors might be associated with the ATP reduction resulted from stress responsive mechanisms or cell death resulted from excessive environmental stress, which further decreased the bioluminescence by lower ATP and cell viability [17,66]. It is worth noting that the genes of biolumi­nescence can be genetically engineered in other lab- cultivable bacteria such as E. coli. Similarly, the con­stitutively expressed bioluminescence of these toxi­city-based nonspecific biosensors would diminish upon the exposure of toxicants, thereby making them capable of quantifying the general toxicity equivalent of multiple pollutants [66].

For example, the pH decrease and conductivity increase resulted from sulfur oxidation was inhibited by the toxicants [37], which might be due to the bacterial death or disrupted microbial functions. Based on the inhibition level, toxicity could be quantified by using iron and sulfur oxidizing bacteria [37–39]. The recA and its promoter responsible for DNA repair and main­tenance were widely used in DNA damage- sensing biosensors for their response to geno­toxic compounds and pharmaceuticals [34,68,69]. Recent studies have applied both recA-based and metabolic inhibition-based bio­luminescence bacterial biosensor for pollutants such as toxic metals in urban rivers and seawater [70,71]. Similarly, the stress-inducible heat shock genes like hsp70 and its promoter were used in biosensors for detecting nonspecific toxicity since the heat shock protein systems will be triggered not only by heat shock but also other environmental stressors, and then induce the downstream fused signals [72,73].",11.5,False,5,306.0259094238281,51.62204360961914,False,False,False,body

"The metabolic inhibition-based bioluminescence bacterial biosensors have been developed and uti­lized in several pollutants detection [74]. Different signaling elements producing bioluminescence such as luciferase were used in the construction of bacterial biosensor, or naturally presented in bacteria that could be directly used in sensing [74]. The luciferase genes from bacteria and firefly have been suggested to be highly sensitive and broadly used as a reporter gene. The luxCDABE from bacterial operon is conservative in many bacteria species [75]. The luxAB is enough for producing the luminescence, while using the whole luxCDABE operon could reduce the amount of additional substrates that is needed for lumines­cence reaction [15].

On the other hand, the energy-consuming lux operon reaction in Vibro spp. could also reflect the metabolic state of the microorganisms [66]. Therefore, the biolu­minescence biosensors with lux operon such as Microtox (Vibrio fischeri) were applied in assessing the toxicity of environmental pollutants in river and sediment samples [71,77,78].

"Microbial fuel cell (MFC)-based biosensors with single- or dual-chamber design were developed based on the oxidation of organic compounds and the corresponding electrical currents [80,81]. The dual chambers of MFC-based biosensors consist of an anaerobic anodic chamber where the oxidation happens and aerobic cathodic chamber, transferring electrons through circuits and protons through the ion-exchange membrane from anode to cathode [82]. MFC-based biosensors can detect the water quality and wastewater parameters such as biologi­cal oxygen demand (BOD) and toxins [81]. Compared with nonspecific whole-cell biosensors, MFC-based biosensors save more energy and are portable; they produce the electrical current and do not need signal transducers [82]. It has been reported that heavy metals such as copper and arsenic in wastewater were detected by MFC- based biosensor based on the toxicity associated inhibition [83]. The bacteria strains for organics degradation could be mixed culture from activated sludge, and the toxicants in wastewater could be sensed by the inhibited degradation [82]. In addi­tion to pollutant-degrading bacteria, the electroac­tive bacteria such as Geobacter and Shewanella were shown to facilitate the current production in MFC- based biosensor [84]. Other bacterial strains in MFC-based biosensors for sensing specific pollu­tants were also reported in recent studies. For example, the linear alkylbenzene sulfonate could be simultaneously quantified and degraded domi­nantly by Pseudomonas species, generating electrical power using a MFC-based biosensor [85]. To increase the selectivity for specific detection, Cr(VI)-reducing bacterium Exiguobacterium aes­tuarii YC211 was cultured in a MFC-based biosen­sor system [86]. It can detect in situ Cr(VI) in industrial wastewater via the electrical currents gen­erated from the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) [86], which suggests the possibility of specific detection and indigenous bacterium application in MFC- based biosensors.

"To detect specific pollutants, genetic methods using detoxification and metabolism genes to dif­ferentiate environmental pollutants have been developed.

Biodegradable organic pollu­tants in the whole-cell biosensors trigger metabolic mechanisms and the downstream utilizing pro­teins or signals such as bioluminescence [8,90]. Subsequently, it is difficult to detect biodegradable organic pollutants since the metabolism mechan­isms are unclear in the microorganisms. However, recent research has developed a whole-cell biosen­sor to detect persistent polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) using genome-wide screening.

"Heavy metals pollution is usually discharged as a result of anthropogenic and industrial activities (e.g., refineries, metal works, mining, cement fac­tories, smelting plants, etc.), and their pollution endangers human health and the environment [95–97]. Elements such as Fe, Cu, Mn, and Zn, then highly toxic Pb, Cr, Cd, As, Hg, etc, are very resistant to biodegradation. Heavy metals are transported into the environment, especially water sources and easily absorbed by living organ­isms. Due to their pronounced toxicity, these heavy metals are important for monitoring the environment (water, wastewater, air, solid waste, and organisms) [95,97,98]. Monitoring water con­tamination is essential for environmental conser­vation and the prevention of illnesses. Due to the accumulation in the environment (e.g., water, soil, sediment) and wildlife such as plants, animals over a long period of time, heavy metals pose a serious danger. Several methods have been devised to detect their concentrations and presence in the environmental matrix. Especially, biosensors can detect the levels of heavy metals and determine how much pollution they cause.

"The whole-cell biosensors illustrate a prospective technique for the detection/monitor­ing of heavy metals and are critical to selectivity and sensitivity [70,100,103]. Using biosensors for continuous and/or individual detection and mea­surements normally depends on the biologically active element types. Also, biosensors (i.e., organ­isms) can be integrated into pollutants exposure and used as a method for predicting chemical pollution in the environment. The literature review demonstrated that Shen et al. [104] designed a toxicity MFC system for detecting Cu concentrations of 5–7 mg L–1 in a quick speedy response, and Wu et al. [105] also found at a level of 12 mg L–1 in their study. Recently, by using the decrease in the cell voltage, the MFC biosensor could monitor arsenic (0.5–5.0 mg L–1) and cop­per (1.0–10 mg L–1) with added Cu/As to the anolyte solution [83]. Wu et al. [86] inoculated a facultative anaerobe bacterium into an MFC to investigate an in-situ Cr6+ detection sensor. In their research, Wu et al. [105] developed a new sediment MFC-based toxic sensor for online and in-situ Cu2+ monitoring by using bacteria species such as Clostridium and Geobacter. A similar study was conducted using Pseudomonas and Geobacter for in-situ Cr6+ detection in real-time from indus­trial wastewater [106]. Researchers have recently become interested in electro-active biofilms because of their potential applications in environ­mental monitoring as amperometric biosensors, i.e., in-situ toxicant detection. For the assessment of heavy metal contamination in tap water, an O2 reducing microbial cathode-based MFC biosensor was designed, with detection limits in the 1.0 to 10 mg L–1 range for ions, including Cr6+, Hg2+ and Pb2+ [107]. As a result, biosensors can accurately reflect the harmful effects of numerous contami­nants in the environment.

"Several biosensors based on electrochemical, colorimetric, and fluorescence measurements were successfully devised for heavy metal detection [114–116]. It has been suggested that the nanoma­terials such as metal oxide and nanostructured carbon could be effectively used in biosensors development [5,117–119]. In addition, several nanomaterials with heterostructure such as α-Fe2 O3–g–C3N4, V2O5 g–C3N4, and CuS–WuO3 were developed, indicating the potential use in electro­chemical biosensors [120–122]. For electrochemi­cal sensors, nano-scale structures are attractive materials [123], and their huge specific surface can enhance enzyme, signaling molecule, and cat­alyst immobilization. Applying electrochemical DNA biosensors for heavy metals detection includes implementing core-shell nanoparticles, nicking enzyme–assisted amplification, and nano­composites modification [124,125]. Apart from these, applications of nanomaterials based on elec­trochemical nucleic acid (NA) biosensors for quantitative and qualitative analysis/monitoring of environmental pollutants, e.g., heavy metals have been discussed [126,127]. Table 2 demon­strates how biosensors were classified depending on the recognition component that was used for detecting heavy metals. For example, the bioavail­able copper ions in synthetic samples were mon­itored by biosensor used as an optical transducer and immobilized engineered bacterium Alcaligenes eutrophus (AE1239), with the limit of detection (LOD) being 1 μM [128]. DNA-based electrodes biosensor is an excellent candidate for Hg detec­tion, with a LOD of 3 fM [127]. Another DNA biosensor using electrode modification with Fe3O4 @3D-GO reached an excellent LOD for Ag+ ion detection, which was equal to 2.0 pM and in the wide range of 0.01–100 nM [129].

"DNA biosensors focusing on the recent design of selective and sensitive detection of heavy metal elements/ions by electrochemical transduction are depicted in Table 2. DNA biosensors used electro­chemical transduction to provide a suitable plat­form for early monitoring/detection of heavy metal ions. Many effective DNA biosensors based on various electrochemical redox indicators have been applied for Ag+, Hg2+, Pb2+ ions detection [99]. A bacterial whole-cell biosensor (Acinetobacter baylyi Tox2) was designed to detect heavy metal cytotoxicity in the polluted seawater sources [70]. Consequently, A. baylyi Tox2 exhi­bits excellent application as a sensitive and quick biosensor for investigating cytotoxicity in the mar­ine environment. Many detection methods have been assessed using the 8–17 DNAzyme specific for lead ions [115,130,131]. Shen et al.

For instance, autocatalytic DNA circuit based on exonuclease III and G-quadruplex DNAzyme for mercury ions detection achieved high selectivity and sensi­tivity.

A novel whole-cell microbial biosensor was invented for rapid on- site detection related to Hg contaminated soil with gas signals [102]. This technique could detect bioavailable mercury levels within 45 min and a range from 5 to 500 μM, effectively showing how much pollution there was in the soil. Guo et al.

"An overview of the current achievements of biosensors and those devised to monitor organic pollutants was done in this section. Monitoring of organic contaminants plays an important role in the protection of human health and the eco­system. By applying a biosensor, the rapid detec­tion and screening of organic contaminants can be achieved. These biosensors are quite inexpen­sive, portable, available for on-site use, and no waste is generated during analysis. However, there are some limitations of these biosensors such as sensitivity and selectivity of the target pollutants, limiting applicability. Some chal­lenges need to be overcome for biosensors including interference of humidity, effect of pH on sensitivity and selectivity, enhancing the sus­tainability of sensing components of biosensors, and ensuring the adaptation of nanomaterials, which can improve the performance of biosen­sors. More knowledge of metabolic genes for POPs is needed for further improvement of sen­sing elements.
