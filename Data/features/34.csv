"Nonspecific whole-cell biosensors are constructed mainly by stress responsive genetic regulation, such as heat shock and DNA damage responses [6]. Information about bioavailability and toxicity can be revealed by nonspecific cell-based biosensors. The damage done to protein will trigger heat shock stress- related genes, which could be used as a sensing ele­ment of nonspecific cell-based biosensors for pollu­tants that damage protein [30–32]. The expression of SOS response genes enhanced by DNA damage could be incorporated in nonspecific sensing elements [33– 36]. Indigenous bacteria and their activity as far as environmental stress is concerned could also serve as a nonspecific whole-cell biosensor. For example, sul­fur oxidizing and iron oxidizing abilities in certain types of bacteria would be inhibited by toxic pollutants and could be used for acid samples [37–39]. As well, indigenous bacterium isolated from soil environments was successfully engineered with green fluorescent protein (GFP) signaling gene, which could help assess bioavailable heavy metals in the soils by the GFP signals [40]. The nonspecific biosensor based on the stress response provides an early warning of hazard presence in samples that could be harmful for micro­organisms despite the lack of selectivity.",11.5,False,4,51.02360153198242,245.22662353515625,False,False,False,H3
"Wastewater discharge is the one of the source of environmental pollution, and the wastewater qual­ity monitoring could be also achieved by the bio­sensors [145]. The biosensors especially MFC- based were applied in wastewater monitoring glob­ally. In Asia Pacific countries, it has been reported that Au3+ ions in wastewater from Taiwan could be detected by engineered bacteria [174]. In addi­tion, The MFC-based BOD biosensor was used in monitoring swine wastewater in Japan, which minimizes the energy cost for aeration [175]. The multiple heavy metals and phenols in real waste­water samples from China were able to be detected by MFC-based biosensors [176]. The immobilized engineered bacteria were used in screening PAHs in industrial wastewater in India [177]. The toxic metals (Cr6+ and Fe3+), NO3",11.1,False,14,51.02360153198242,415.9296569824219,False,False,False,H2
