"1. BackgroundThis document summarises the documentation and the finding of the peer review of the triggerused in OCHA’s Philippines Anticipatory Action framework for typhoons. The impact predictionmodel used as the basis for the trigger was developed by the Netherlands Red Cross 510 dataand digital team, on behalf of the IFRC network and its partners. The model uses typhoon trackand rainfall forecasts to predict the percentage of houses that will be severely damaged permunicipality in the Philippines. OCHA Philippines used this model as a basis to begin a responsebefore a typhoon hit, based on the predicted number of houses damaged in the regions of Bicoland Eastern Visayas. To find out more about this application, please see the Anticipatory ActionFramework for the Philippines.",11.08,False,2,72.0,228.5208740234375,False,False,True,body

Intended Use,12.0,False,3,72.0,72.26953125,False,True,False,body
●The target of the model is P (#damaged houses > threshold t). Several combinations ofProbability P and threshold t are used as a trigger for early action. Make a clearstatement under which circumstance which combination is used. This will help with laterevaluation of the model and transparency of its use.,11.0,False,3,90.0,88.8096923828125,False,False,False,body
Model Development,12.0,False,3,72.0,164.74462890625,False,True,False,body
"●As mentioned in the ethical review, more information about the sources of the input datais desirable. The model should include information on how often the data sets areupdated, and how often the model is retrained to reflect these updates.",11.0,False,3,90.0,181.28466796875,False,False,False,body
Model Evaluation,12.0,False,3,72.0,242.0372314453125,False,True,False,body
"●The model is compared against a damage curve that is currently used to estimatedamage. Adjust this benchmark to whichever model or algorithm is used by thePhilippine authorities to estimate damage.●Specify how much variance in model performance is acceptable, i.e., with the modelworkingonaveragebetterthanthebenchmark,howmuchextremeover/underestimation is acceptable for field use. More specifically, indicate how robust themodel performance is over different typhoons.",11.0,False,3,90.0,258.577392578125,False,False,False,body
Operational Readiness,12.0,False,3,72.0,380.0595703125,False,True,False,body
"●For every model version, make a model release and keep an updated list of associatedinput data. This will make reproducibility of earlier results easier and help keep track ofthe data sources (and whose responsibility those are).",11.0,False,3,90.0,396.599853515625,False,False,False,body

InaccuracyThe model performance scores for 2021 Typhoon Surigae are not reported. The rationale forusing the given error / accuracy tool and not others is missing. The model does not perform wellat predicting really low and really high damage.,11.25,False,3,72.0,489.097412109375,False,False,False,body
●Recommendation: (1) Report latest error scores; (2) Contextualise the quality of the errorscores in light of existing and relevant research; (3) Include the rationale for using aparticular method of calculating error score as opposed to others.,11.0,False,3,90.0,551.18505859375,False,False,False,body
"False NegativesIn the case of Typhoon Goni in 2020, the model did not predict an extreme event until only a fewhours before landfall.",11.33,False,3,72.0,611.9375,False,False,False,body
"●Recommendation: If the model does have 100% weightage in the activation of thetrigger, then the possibility of a false negative should be clear operationally, e.g., in thecase of Typhoon Goni. This is of particular importance because we know that the modeldoes perform well in cases of rapid intensification or high damage scenarios.",11.0,False,3,90.0,658.842529296875,False,False,False,body
"Missing AttributesThe implementation model mentions a priority list based on poverty, gender, and building material,while the model uses poverty, hazard data, and building type where poverty is not disaggregatedunless it follows some national standard of income levels to estimate poverty lines.",11.25,False,4,72.0,87.4521484375,False,False,False,body
"●Recommendation: Clarity is required on the relative importance of variables used, andconsistency between the model and the implementation plan. There needs to be adistinction drawn between the model and how the outputs of the model are used. Cleardelineation between input data (inclusion / exclusion criteria etc.); modelling process,output, and use; and validation / verification, with a clear trail of documentation.",11.0,False,4,90.0,149.539794921875,False,False,False,body
"Lead TimesLead time is the length of time between when a forecast is output and the occurrence of theshock that was forecasted. It is unclear the impact that forecast running time has on lead timesfor implementation. In the case of Typhoon Ursula (Phanfone) in 2019, the trigger was reachedonly 12 hours prior to landfall for which no humanitarian action could be planned.",11.2,False,4,72.0,240.656982421875,False,False,False,body
"●Recommendation: In the implementation plan, more clarity is required on potentialoperational impact of long lead times, especially with 100% weightage of model outputfor trigger activation. The effect of different lead times is unclear for the implementation.To quote one of the documents: 'It takes several hours for the forecast to run so theinitial conditions are already often outdated'.",11.0,False,4,90.0,317.927001953125,False,False,False,body
Decision SupportDecision support concerns the extent to which action based on model output.,11.5,False,4,72.0,409.044189453125,False,False,False,body
"●Recommendation: Clarity is required in the implementation plan about weightage ofmodel output on trigger activation, i.e., how much of the decision to act depends on themodel output. If this is not 100%, then the other considerations should be described.●Recommendation: Given the possibility of a false negative, operational readiness in caseof model failure should be detailed in the implementation plan.",11.0,False,4,90.0,440.76708984375,False,False,False,body
"Statistical BiasStatistical bias occurs when a model or statistic is not representative of the underlyingpopulation. In this model, different input datasets are used to model different typhoon scenarios,social vulnerability / poverty data is not sufficiently disaggregated for evaluation, and the relativeimportance / weightage of the variables in the model is unclear.",11.2,False,4,72.0,531.88427734375,False,False,False,body
"●Recommendation: The model requires clear documentation of the different datasetsused, particularly the rationale behind parameters used and their disaggregation, e.g.,poverty index. Discrepancies on this front exist between the model card andimplementation plan, and the model would benefit from their harmonisation. It wouldalso be useful to include these in an overview of the model development process, i.e., therelative weighting and importance of these variables, and how the model changes whenthey change.",11.0,False,4,90.0,609.154296875,False,False,False,body
Lack of TransparencyThe model is open source and has undergone technical review but is missing somedocumentation.,11.33,False,5,72.0,87.451904296875,False,False,False,body

"Systemic BiasSystemic bias is the inherent tendency of a process to support specific outcomes. In this mode,social vulnerability and poverty data are not substantially disaggregated. The move from 'commondataset' to 'composite dataset' involved ranking of variables.",11.25,False,5,72.0,195.109375,False,False,False,body
