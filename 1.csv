1. BackgroundThis document summarizes the documentation and findings of the peer review of the modelused by the UN Central Emergency Response Fund to trigger the drought anticipatory actionframework in Chad. The model is a go-no-go trigger mechanism designed to anticipatehumanitarian impacts of seasonal drought in a sub-region of Chad.,11.14,False,2,72.0,228.5208740234375,False,False,True,body
The review has been conducted between January and May 2023.,11.0,False,2,72.0,320.973388671875,False,False,False,body
"2. Main Findings and RecommendationsYou can find all the documentation regarding the model, its application and the review processat the following links:",11.33,False,2,72.0,351.36083984375,False,False,True,body
"●The Model Card describes the version of the model that was endorsed by humanitarianaction in November 2022 and was completed in January 2023.●The Model Evaluation Matrix was completed in February 2023 by Carlos Osorio-Ramírez,Associate Professor at Universidad Nacional de Colombia.●The Implementation Plan was completed in February 2023. It summarizes how thetrigger model is used to trigger anticipatory action and the agreed activation protocol.●The Ethical Matrix aims to identify all stakeholders and potential issues regarding theintended use of the model. The Ethical Matrix was completed in May 2023 by Anna LenaHuhn, Southern Africa Regional Anticipatory Action Advisor at the United Nations WorldFood Programme.",11.0,False,2,90.0,398.2659912109375,False,False,False,body
A summary of the main findings and recommendations is provided below.,11.0,False,2,72.0,565.2730712890625,False,False,False,body
2.1 Technical Review,12.0,False,2,72.0,597.040771484375,False,True,True,body
"Intended UseOverall, the use cases are well-described and adequately explained. The documentation of thelimitations of the model could be extended in its description, as is the case of the biomassanomaly and its connection with scenarios like extreme dryness or late onset.",11.25,False,2,72.0,630.1661376953125,False,False,False,body
"Model Development and DocumentationIt is advisable to provide further documentation on the different data sources used by the teamto validate the selection of indicators and estimate the performance of the model. Also, somedata is not available in a machine readable format and it would be good to explain how the teamdealt with this issue.",11.2,False,3,72.0,88.8321533203125,False,False,False,body
Model EvaluationIt is unclear what is an acceptable level of accuracy for the model. The team should betterarticulate how the performance benchmark was established and how the performance metricswere evaluated and presented to the final stakeholders.,11.25,False,3,72.0,182.6875,False,False,False,body
Operational ReadinessIt would be good to expand the analysis of the missed activations of the models and thepotential false alarms that the model could be providing.,11.33,False,3,72.0,261.3603515625,False,False,False,body
2.2 Ethical Review,12.0,False,3,72.0,323.470458984375,False,True,True,body
False NegativesA false negative occurs when no drought impact is predicted but drought conditions occur.The team could consider additional mitigation strategies such as the use of citizen science orground observations to complement the forecast-based trigger.,11.25,False,3,72.0,355.215576171875,False,False,False,body
"Insufficient DataInsufficient data refers to the gaps in impact data used to verify the forecast predictions.Insufficient data might limit the precise prediction of forecasted humanitarian impact andexpose local populations to adverse humanitarian impact induced by a drought event, requiringa large-scale humanitarian response ex-post. The team should consider the feasibility of addingfurther vulnerability layers in future iterations of the model.",11.17,False,3,72.0,432.508056640625,False,False,False,body
"False PositivesA false positive happens when drought impact is predicted but no drought conditions occur.Anticipatory action follows the ‘no regret’ principle, but a false alarm can still lead to inadequateresource allocation with a high potential impact on affected communities. The anticipatoryaction framework could indicate a precise mitigation strategy in a clearer manner.",11.2,False,3,72.0,540.165771484375,False,False,False,body
Lack of Trust and OwnershipLack of trust and ownership refers to the limited involvement of local and regional authorities inthe model design and validation. This may lead to little ownership and trust put into the modeland eventually to political blockages in activations. In future framework versions a clear strategy,11.25,False,3,72.0,632.640625,False,False,False,H3
for the involvement of affected populations and an approach to accountability to affectedpopulations should be identified.,11.0,False,4,72.0,72.2470703125,False,False,False,body
Lack of TransparencyLack of transparency refers to the algorithms not being made available or not being transparent.The anticipatory action framework should reflect clearer strategies to engage with local leadersto better understand what is happening on the ground and obtain early buy-in. Mitigationstrategy for a potential lack of transparency should be expanded in the model card and/or theanticipatory action framework.,11.17,False,4,72.0,117.81689453125,False,False,False,body
"InactionInaction refers to the situation in which drought impact is predicted but no action is taken.Inaction in case of trigger activation is unlikely, given the pre-allocated financing attached to itand the UN-validated anticipatory action framework. Inaction might nevertheless be apossibility, if government or local authorities block the roll-out of interventions on the ground orincaseofconflictupsurge.Theteamcouldconsideraddingaconsensus-baseddecision-making option around activation or non-activation in the event of specific events orsituational context not considered in the model design (e.g., higher levels of vulnerability orincrease in armed conflict, etc.)",11.05,False,4,72.0,225.474365234375,False,False,False,body
"FeedbackThe Centre invites individuals and organizations working in the humanitarian, academic,research and private sector to engage with us on the peer review process. Please send feedbackon the Framework to centrehumdata@un.org.",11.17,False,4,72.0,378.67919921875,False,False,False,body
