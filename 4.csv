1. BackgroundThis document summarizes the documentation and findings developed in the peer review of theAnticipatory Action Trigger for Drought in Niger. The trigger mechanism was designed for ananticipatory action framework coordinated by OCHA. The goal of the trigger mechanism is todetect increased drought risk in Niger and trigger the release of funds from the CentralEmergency Response Fund in anticipation of drought-related humanitarian needs. The releaseof funds can be triggered from six months ahead of the rainy season (which runs from Julythrough September) until one month into the season. The trigger mechanism includes apredictive model that uses seasonal precipitation forecasts and an observational model thatuses the Standardized Precipitation Index.,11.1,False,2,72.0,228.5208740234375,False,False,True,body

It was completed byOCHA in June 2022 and updated in October 2022.●The Model Evaluation Matrix presents the outcomes of the technical review and wascompleted by Mohammad Shamsudduha, Associate Professor in Humanitarian Scienceat the Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction, University College London, in December2022.●The Implementation Plan summarizes the concrete actions that the trigger mechanismwill inform and was developed by OCHA in October 2022.●The Ethical Matrix identifies issues that may come up in the implementation of thetrigger mechanism and stakeholders that may be impacted by those issues.

Intended Use,12.0,False,3,72.0,121.95751953125,False,True,False,body
"●The intended use of the predictive model is appropriate.●The model may not detect localized rainfall shortages, which could lead to the modelmissing a trigger where it should detect increased drought risk. In addition, crop failuredepends on a number of factors other than rainfall, including the use and availability ofgroundwater for irrigation as well as changes in temperature. The fact that theseadditional factors are not included in the model should be considered in theinterpretation of model outputs.",11.0,False,3,90.0,138.4979248046875,False,False,False,body
Model Development and Documentation,12.0,False,3,72.0,259.9801025390625,False,False,False,body
"●The resolution of the spatial coverage of the predictive model is very high at 0.05degrees. The predictive model produces outputs on a monthly basis. The geographicscope of the predictive model includes the entire country of Niger. These parameters areappropriate for a national-scale model.●The spatial resolution of the predictive model at 0.05 degrees is too high given that thepredictive model is primarily dependent on precipitation variability. Correlation betweenforecasts and observational rainfall data produced by CHIRPS is weak in Maradi andNiamey regions, where the irrigation is the highest in the country.",11.0,False,3,90.0,276.520263671875,False,False,False,body
Model Evaluation,12.0,False,3,72.0,413.18505859375,False,True,False,body
"●The predictive model is evaluated using accuracy, hit rate, miss rate, false positives andfalse negatives as parameters. These model evaluation criteria are appropriate for thispredictive model.●A comparison between the predictive model outputs and NextGen forecasts was basedonly on CHIRPS gridded rainfall data. No detailed information is provided on thedownscaling of the forecasts and evaluation of the downscaled technique.",11.0,False,3,90.0,429.72509765625,False,False,False,body

●Activities and funding are provided on a “no-regrets” basis after a trigger activation.Activities and funding are purposefully selected to still be valuable in the absence of ashock. The addition of an observational trigger based on SPI is a strength of thisanticipatory trigger mechanism.●The forecast accuracy could be improved if the predictive model is tailored to individualareas within Niger.●There is little mention of local/national capacity building or strengthening in the process.●The performance of the predictive model should be evaluated against the observationalmodeloutputsto better understand the weaknesses in the predictive model.Strengthening the predictive model outputs increases the potential impact of the triggermechanism due to the increased lead time.,11.0,False,3,90.0,552.5654296875,False,False,False,body
●The low or even negative correlation between the predictive model outputs and CHIRPSprecipitation in the northern part of Niger should be examined to improve theperformance and validity of the predictive model.,11.0,False,4,90.0,72.2470703125,False,False,False,body

False negative activation (non-activation in the presence of a shock),11.5,False,4,72.0,179.92724609375,False,False,False,body
●A false negative would deprive the community of timely aid.●Recommendation: The outputs of the predictive model should be continuously evaluatedagainst the outputs of the observational model and against CHIRPS precipitation data tolower the likelihood of false negatives.,11.0,False,4,90.0,196.46728515625,False,False,False,body
False positive activation (activation in the absence of a shock),11.5,False,4,72.0,272.402099609375,False,False,False,body
"●A false positive would increase the risk of wasted financial resources. Such error couldundermine the confidence of stakeholders and donors and could lead to discontinuationof the trigger mechanism. A false negative primarily impacts other stakeholders,including local NGOs, the model developers and UN entities, due to the misallocation ofresources. It also undermines trust in the trigger mechanism.●Recommendation: A false positive is more tolerable compared to a false negative, as afalse positive triggers activities and funding that benefit the population even in theabsence of a shock. The outputs of the predictive model should be continuouslyevaluated against the outputs of the observational model and against CHIRPSprecipitation data to lower the likelihood of false positives.",11.0,False,4,90.0,288.9423828125,False,False,False,body
Identity exposure (exposure of individual identities through potential use of additional datasources in implementation of the model),11.33,False,4,72.0,455.971923828125,False,False,False,body
"●Unauthorized access to any personal data used in future implementation of the triggermechanism could cause harm and carries reputational risk.●Recommendation: Given that the trigger mechanism does not include the use of anypersonal data there is little concern that a data breach could result in re-identification. Ifthe implementation of the trigger mechanism evolves over time to include additionalpersonal data, the tools and infrastructure used in implementation should bere-evaluated and adjusted as needed to mitigate the risk of identity exposure.",11.0,False,4,90.0,487.69482421875,False,False,False,body

●Bias in data availability resulting from gaps in data for different regions in Niger couldaffect the allocation of funding and activities.●Recommendation: Determine whether there are gaps resulting in biases in climate dataavailability for Niger in order to prevent unfair allocation of funding and activities.,11.0,False,4,90.0,625.71728515625,False,False,False,body
