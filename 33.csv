"Photodetectors are vital components in modern technology, with applications rangingfrom environmental monitoring to communication systems, imaging, and medical diagnos-tics [1]. The ability to detect light and convert it into an electrical signal is a fundamentalprocess that has driven the development of various devices, including cameras, solarcells, and optical sensors [2,3]. Over the past few decades, the field of photodetection hasundergone significant transformation, propelled by advances in material science, deviceengineering, and the emergence of new applications demanding higher performance.The discovery and development of emerging photodetecting materials have openedup new avenues for innovation. Traditional photodetectors, primarily based on silicon, facelimitations in sensitivity, speed, and the range of detectable wavelengths [4–10]. In contrast,new materials such as perovskites [11,12], polymers [13–15], two-dimensional (2D) mate-rials [16,17], and quantum dots (QDs) [18–20] offer unique properties that can overcomethese limitations. For instance, perovskites are known for their exceptional light absorptionand charge transport capabilities, while 2D materials like graphene and transition metaldichalcogenides (TMDs) exhibit remarkable electronic and optoelectronic properties, in-cluding high carrier mobility and tunable bandgaps [21–25].

"improvements in key performance metrics such as responsivity, detectivity, response speed,and spectral range [26–30]. For example, quantum dots offer size-tunable optical properties,allowing photodetectors to be designed for specific wavelength ranges, from ultraviolet(UV) to infrared (IR). Similarly, 2D materials like MoS2 and WS2 provide excellent op-portunities for ultra-thin, flexible, and transparent photodetectors that can be seamlesslyintegrated into wearable devices and other flexible electronics. These advancements arenot limited to enhancing performance but also include novel device architectures suchas phototransistors, photonic crystals, and plasmonic-enhanced photodetectors, whichleverage the unique properties of the materials to achieve highly efficient light matterinteractions [31–35].In parallel with material and structural innovations, new applications for photodetec-tors continue to emerge, particularly in fields such as healthcare and environmental sensingas shown in Figure 1.

"in the synthesis of novel materials, have led to a new generation of photodetecting deviceswith enhanced optical, electrical, and mechanical properties [39–42]. The continuous ex-ploration of emerging materials, such as perovskites, organic polymers, two-dimensional(2D) materials, and quantum dots, has opened up avenues for creating high-performancephotodetectors that not only surpass conventional technologies but also introduce entirelynew capabilities. These materials exhibit unique properties that offer flexibility in de-sign and functionality, allowing for the tailoring of photodetectors to meet the stringentrequirements of various modern applications.Perovskites, with their remarkable light absorption and tunable bandgaps, provide anefficient platform for capturing a wide range of wavelengths, from ultraviolet to infrared,making them ideal for applications in imaging, environmental monitoring, and telecom-munications. Organic polymers, on the other hand, bring the advantage of mechanicalflexibility, lightweight construction, and the ability to be processed using cost-effectivemethods such as printing or solution-based techniques. This enables their integrationinto flexible electronics and wearable devices, positioning them as key components fornext-generation health monitoring systems, flexible displays, and smart textiles.The rise of two-dimensional materials, including graphene and transition metaldichalcogenides (TMDs), has further expanded the scope of photodetection technolo-gies. These atomically thin materials exhibit exceptional electrical conductivity, tunableoptical properties, and strong light-matter interaction, making them highly suitable forultrathin, transparent, and flexible photodetectors. The ability to integrate 2D materialsinto transparent and flexible substrates provides a new dimension to photodetector design,particularly in wearable electronics, heads-up displays, and soft robotics.Quantum dots, with their size-tunable optical and electronic properties, offer unpar-alleled precision in wavelength selectivity, making them ideal for highly sensitive andefficient photodetectors. The unique quantum confinement effects in QDs allow for thefine-tuning of their optical response across the UV, visible, and IR spectra. This tunabilitymakes them highly versatile for applications in advanced imaging systems, optical commu-nication, medical diagnostics, and environmental sensing. Moreover, their compatibilitywith solution-processable techniques allows for scalable fabrication on large-area flexiblesubstrates, broadening their application in transparent and flexible optoelectronics.Beyond their individual advantages, the ability to control the synthesis and integrationof these emerging materials plays a pivotal role in optimizing device performance [43–48].Precise control over material composition, structure, and interface quality is critical inimproving key photodetector performance metrics such as sensitivity, responsivity, noiseequivalent power (NEP), and detectivity. Different material synthesis methods, includingsolution-based methods, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), spin coating, and mechanicalexfoliation, exhibit significant differences in achieving material properties and performance,and their synthesis conditions have a direct impact on the final properties of the materials.Solution-based methods are commonly used for material synthesis and are especiallysuitable for the preparation of nanomaterials and thin films. During synthesis, factors suchas solution concentration, reaction temperature, and reaction time are crucial in determiningmaterial quality. By adjusting the solution concentration, one can control the crystallinityand particle size of the material, while controlling the reaction temperature and time canaffect the uniformity and stability of the film. For example, by precisely controlling thetemperature and time during the reaction, high-quality films can be obtained with smoothsurfaces and uniform thickness, which are essential for effective light absorption and carriermobility in optoelectronic applications.Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is an ideal choice for the synthesis of 2D materials.A significant advantage of the CVD method is its capability to produce uniform, layer-controllable films on a large scale. By adjusting reaction conditions, such as gas flow rate,deposition temperature, and reaction time, different layer numbers and crystal quality of2D materials can be obtained. Specifically, for materials like MoS2, the CVD method canprecisely control the thickness and crystal orientation, thus improving the optoelectronic",9.95,False,3,165.97500610351562,89.75108337402344,False,False,False,body

"properties of the film. In addition, spin coating is widely used in the preparation of solution-based materials to produce uniform films. During the spin-coating process, by changingthe spin rate and duration, the thickness and uniformity of the film can be adjusted. Higherspin rates can reduce solvent residues, resulting in a uniform film. The post-spin thermaltreatment also significantly influences the electrical properties of the material; properannealing temperature and time can improve the crystallinity of the film, reduce interfacedefect density, and thus enhance device performance.Mechanical exfoliation is suitable for preparing single-layer 2D materials under lab-oratory conditions. Although this method is not suitable for large-scale production, it isoften used in research because it can yield high-purity, defect-free single-layer materialswith optimal material properties. Quantum dot materials are typically synthesized throughcolloidal methods. By controlling the concentration of reactants, reaction temperature, andtime, the size of quantum dots can be precisely controlled, thereby tuning their optical andelectrical properties. Smaller quantum dot sizes result in blue-shifted absorption spectra,suitable for applications requiring high energy gaps, whereas larger quantum dots are moresuitable for optoelectronic conversion applications with lower energy gaps. Furthermore,colloidal synthesis allows for adjustments in surface ligands, thereby improving the stabilityand charge transport efficiency of quantum dots. Advancements in the synthesis of thesematerials enable the development of novel device architectures, such as multi-junction orheterostructure-based photodetectors, which leverage the complementary properties ofdifferent materials to achieve superior performance across a broad spectral range.In addition to traditional applications, these materials hold great promise for en-abling entirely new classes of devices, particularly in the areas of flexible, lightweight, andtransparent photodetectors. These devices are well suited for integration into wearable elec-tronics, where their mechanical flexibility and lightweight nature are essential. For example,photodetectors integrated into wearable health monitoring systems can continuously trackvital signs such as heart rate or blood oxygen levels, enabling real-time, non-invasive medi-cal diagnostics. Similarly, transparent photodetectors could be integrated into displays orwindows, offering new functionalities in consumer electronics and smart buildings.",9.95,False,4,165.97500610351562,89.77630615234375,False,False,False,body

"Perovskites, particularly lead-halide perovskites (ABX3), have attracted considerableattention due to their exceptional optoelectronic properties, including high absorptioncoefficients, long carrier diffusion lengths, and tunable bandgaps [49,50]. Their synthe-sis methods, such as solution processing, vapor deposition, and spin coating, allow forlow-cost and scalable production, making them ideal for large-area photodetector applica-tions [9,18,51–54]. Recent research has focused on improving the stability of perovskites,which tend to degrade under environmental factors like moisture, heat, and light expo-sure [55]. By incorporating additives, passivation techniques, and improved encapsulation,researchers have enhanced the operational stability of perovskite photodetectors. Further-more, the bandgap tunability of perovskites allows for the detection of a broad spectrumof light, from ultraviolet to near-infrared (NIR), making them versatile candidates formulti-spectral photodetectors. Hong et al. introduced a surface tension-dominant crys-tallization technique for developing single perovskite crystals, which were employed invertically oriented hetero-/homojunction photodetectors, as illustrated in Figure 2 [51].Halide perovskites, particularly of the Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) type, exhibit remarkableoptoelectronic properties, including high absorption coefficients, tunable bandgaps, andstrong quantum confinement effects. These attributes are key to enhancing the perfor-mance of photodetectors. The study utilized composition engineering to optimize thequantum well index, and it was observed that perovskites with a quantum well index ofn = 4 delivered superior performance metrics. Specifically, these perovskite-based pho-todetectors exhibited an enhanced photocurrent, a diminished dark current, and an on/offratio exceeding 3.5 orders of magnitude.

"Two-dimensional materials, particularly transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) suchas MoS2, WS2, and graphene, exhibit remarkable electronic and optical properties due totheir atomically thin structures [57–62]. These materials offer high carrier mobility, stronglight–matter interaction, and the ability to confine electrons in two dimensions, leadingto enhanced photodetection capabilities [63,64]. The synthesis of 2D materials is typicallyachieved through techniques such as mechanical exfoliation, chemical vapor deposition,and molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Each method offers different advantages in termsof material quality [65,66], scalability, and integration with existing technologies [67–69].For example, CVD-grown MoS2 and WS2 photodetectors have demonstrated excellentresponsivity and detectivity, particularly in the visible spectrum [70–72]. Furthermore, 2Dmaterials can be stacked to form van der Waals heterostructures, enabling multi-functionalphotodetectors with tunable optoelectronic properties. This makes 2D materials highlyadaptable for applications in ultrathin, flexible, and transparent photodetectors [73,74].Mao et al. developed a highly sensitive 2D photodetector based on a bilayer MoS2combined with 1D silicon nanowires and 0D silver nanoparticles to enhance optoelectronicperformance, as illustrated in Figure 5a–c [75]. The integration of silver nanoparticles leveragesplasmonic effects to significantly improve light absorption and the interaction between lightand the bilayer MoS2. The bilayer MoS2, known for its tunable band gap and high quantumyield, was chosen for its efficient charge carrier generation under light exposure. The resultsshowed that the hybrid photodetector achieved a high responsivity of 402.4 A/W at 532 nm,outperforming other 2D photodetectors without a gate. Furthermore, the system demonstratedan excellent detectivity of 2.34 × 1012 Jones, making it ideal for advanced optoelectronicapplications such as high-performance and low-power photodetectors. Xu et al. explored ahighly efficient photodetector by combining 2D MoS2 with an organic material (BTP-4F) [76].The integration of these materials results in a P-N heterojunction that facilitates ultrafast chargetransfer and significantly reduces dark current. The 2D MoS2 offers excellent propertiesfor photodetection, including high carrier mobility and strong light–matter interactions.Researchers formed a heterojunction with the organic material BTP-4F, which enhances thecharge transfer efficiency and suppresses the dark current by four orders of magnitude, asillustrated in Figure 5d–f. The study demonstrated that the 2D MoS2/BTP-4F photodetectorexhibits an ultrafast response time of 332/274 µs, a significant improvement over pureMoS2 devices, which have response times of around 1.2 s. This fast response is achieveddue to the effective electron transfer between MoS2 and BTP-4F, which facilitates rapidseparation of electron–hole pairs.

"Quantum dots are nanocrystals that exhibit size-dependent optical and electronic prop-erties, making them ideal for wavelength-selective photodetectors. The tunable bandgapof QDs allows for precise control over the absorption spectrum, enabling detection acrossthe UV, visible, and infrared ranges [18,19]. Synthesis methods for quantum dots, such ascolloidal synthesis, provide a high degree of control over size, composition, and surface pas-sivation, ensuring uniformity and stability in photodetector performance [77–79]. Quantumdot-based photodetectors can be incorporated into various device architectures, includingphototransistors and photodiodes, where they offer high quantum efficiency, low noise,and fast response times [20]. Their compatibility with solution-based processing also allowsfor the fabrication of large-area devices on flexible or transparent substrates. Quantumdot photodetectors are particularly promising for applications requiring tunable detectioncapabilities [80], such as imaging, environmental sensing, and optical communications [81].As shown in Figure 6a–d, Zeng et al. present an advancement in photodetectortechnology by integrating graphene quantum dots (GQDs) with quasi-two-dimensionalβ-Ga2O3 [82]. This heterostructure exhibits enhanced photoresponsivity, shorter responsetimes, and improved detection across a broad range of wavelengths, particularly in thedeep-ultraviolet (DUV) region (200–280 nm). The hybrid device outperforms traditionalβ-Ga2O3 photodetectors by leveraging GQDs, which enhance light absorption and gen-erate additional electron–hole pairs, leading to a superior responsivity of approximately2.4 × 105 A/W and a detectivity of 4.3 × 1013 Jones. The external quantum efficiencyreaches 1.2 × 108%, making this design promising for solar-blind photodetectors in applica-tions such as missile tracking, UV sterilization, and environmental sensing. The integrationof GQDs allows for broader spectral sensitivity, extending the detection range to thenear-infrared region, which is a notable improvement over conventional β-Ga2O3 devices.The improved performance is attributed to efficient charge transfer facilitated by the quan-tum confinement effects of GQDs. Kolli et al. developed a broadband, ultra-high-responsivephotodetector using a mixed-dimensional heterojunction of monolayer MoS2 and SnS2quantum dots, as illustrated in Figure 6e,f [83]. The device combines the light absorptioncapabilities of SnS2 quantum dots with the excellent charge transport properties of 2DMoS2, creating a highly efficient photoactive interface. This hybrid structure enhanceslight–matter interactions and enables the photodetector to operate across a broad spectralrange from ultraviolet to near-infrared. The results demonstrated that the hybrid photode-tector achieved a responsivity of 278 A/W in the UV range, 435 A/W in the visible range,and 189 A/W in the NIR range. Additionally, the photodetector exhibited fast responsetimes (~100 ms), making it suitable for applications requiring rapid detection and response.Zhang et al. developed a high-performance photodetector based on a heterojunction be-tween amorphous indium gallium zinc oxide (a-IGZO) and lead sulfide (PbS) quantumdots (Figure 6g,h) [84]. The PbS quantum dots, known for their tunable bandgap andhigh optical absorption in the near-infrared (NIR) range, were combined with the a-IGZOlayer, which acts as a photocurrent amplifier. This structure significantly enhances thephotocurrent by up to 3000 times compared to standalone PbS quantum dot devices.

"The emergence of novel photodetector structures has significantly influenced the field,pushing the boundaries of device performance and enabling unique functionalities thatwere previously unattainable with conventional architectures. Innovations in device design,including heterostructures, multi-junction devices, plasmonic-enhanced photodetectors,and photonic crystal-based structures, have improved key performance metrics such assensitivity, speed, and spectral range [85]. These new structures have been engineered totake advantage of the distinct optical and electronic properties of emerging materials, suchas perovskites, two-dimensional materials, and quantum dots, further enhancing deviceefficiency and expanding their range of applications [86].One of the key advancements in novel photodetector structures is the developmentof heterostructure-based designs, where multiple layers of different materials are stackedto create unique energy band alignments [87]. The specific stacking configuration andthe interface quality between these layers play a crucial role in the efficiency of chargeseparation and transport, directly impacting the device’s overall responsivity and noisecharacteristics. Heterojunctions formed through these carefully engineered structures allowfor more efficient charge separation and transport, which not only enhance the device’sresponsivity but also significantly reduce noise.Recent advances in heterostructure-based photodetectors include the integration ofmaterials such as perovskites, transition metal dichalcogenides, and quantum dots intonovel device architectures [86]. For instance, perovskite-based heterostructures have shownimpressive performance improvements, particularly due to their high absorption coeffi-cients and long carrier diffusion lengths. These characteristics have made them suitablefor heterojunction designs, where efficient charge extraction is facilitated by the carefullytailored energy band alignment at the interfaces. Moreover, van der Waals heterostructuresincorporating TMDs like MoS2 and graphene have demonstrated remarkable sensitivitydue to their atomically sharp interfaces, which minimize defect-induced recombinationand provide an excellent pathway for charge carrier transport. In particular, 2D materialslike MoS2 and graphene have been effectively combined with conventional semiconductorsor other 2D materials to form van der Waals heterostructures. The atomic-level precision inthe arrangement of these layers enables highly sensitive detection due to their strong light–matter interactions and fast carrier mobility, which are highly dependent on the interlayercoupling and alignment. Additionally, new device configurations such as staggered type-IIband alignment heterostructures have been utilized to achieve superior charge separation,leading to enhanced photodetection performance across a wide spectral range [88,89].Furthermore, the tunability of band gaps in heterostructures is directly influencedby the number of layers and the way they are stacked, allowing for photodetectors withtailored spectral responses, from ultraviolet to infrared, which is crucial for applications inmulti-spectral imaging and optical communication systems. Recent reports also highlightthe use of quantum dot heterostructures, which combine the size-tunable optical propertiesof quantum dots with the high mobility of 2D materials to achieve broad spectral coverageand enhanced signal-to-noise ratios. These heterostructures can be designed to have stronglight absorption and fast response times, making them highly effective for next-generationoptoelectronic applications.Multi-junction photodetectors represent another leap forward in device performance,with the structural arrangement being key to their capabilities. By stacking multipleabsorbing layers, each optimized for a different portion of the electromagnetic spectrum,the structural design of multi-junction photodetectors allows them to capture a broaderrange of wavelengths compared to single-junction devices [90,91]. The alignment andthickness of these individual layers critically determine the absorption efficiency andthe charge carrier collection, leading to a more comprehensive spectral response.

By integrating metal nanostructures into the photodetector architecture, surfaceplasmon resonances are induced, which concentrate light into sub-wavelength volumes,thereby increasing the local electromagnetic field intensity. The position, size, and shape ofthese plasmonic nanostructures play a significant role in the extent of the enhancement.This structural enhancement leads to more efficient photon absorption, even in ultrathinabsorbing layers, improving the overall quantum efficiency of the device. Plasmonic pho-todetectors are particularly useful in applications that demand high sensitivity, such aslow-light imaging, optical sensors, and high-speed communications. The integration ofplasmonic structures with materials like graphene, 2D TMDs, or quantum dots can furtherboost their performance, with the interfacial engineering and spatial arrangement of theseelements being key factors in determining device efficacy. This makes such devices suit-able for advanced applications in fields like biosensing and wearable technology, wherestructural precision and material interactions are paramount.Another significant innovation is the use of photonic crystal-based structures in pho-todetector design. Photonic crystals are periodic optical nanostructures that can controlthe propagation of light, allowing for the design of devices with tailored optical properties.By incorporating photonic crystals into the photodetector architecture, it is possible to engi-neer devices with highly selective wavelength responses, narrowband filters, or enhancedlight-trapping capabilities. These properties are particularly useful in applications suchas spectral imaging, where detecting specific wavelengths with high precision is crucial.Additionally, photonic crystals can be combined with 2D materials or quantum dots tocreate highly sensitive, wavelength-specific photodetectors with minimal cross-talk andenhanced performance.In addition to the advancements in device architecture, the integration of these novelstructures with advanced fabrication techniques has enabled the development of flexibleand transparent photodetectors.

Transparent conducting electrodes, such as indium tin oxide (ITO) or graphene,are essential components of these photodetectors, allowing for the transmission of lightwhile maintaining electrical conductivity [96,97]. By using transparent materials suchas graphene or certain organic semiconductors, these photodetectors can be seamlesslyintegrated into smart windows that can detect light intensity, adjust transparency, orserve as touch-sensitive panels. Additionally, in augmented reality systems, transparentphotodetectors can be used to track gestures or environmental changes, enhancing userinteraction without the need for external sensors.

"In addition, the electrode structure plays a critical role in photodetectors, directlyaffecting the device’s light absorption efficiency, carrier collection efficiency, and overallresponsivity. Firstly, the shape and material selection of the electrodes has a direct impacton light incidence and the optical absorption characteristics of the device. Transparentelectrodes, such as ITO or graphene, are often used as the top electrode to maximize lightincidence and reduce reflection losses. In addition, the thickness and surface morphologyof metallic electrodes also influence the optical path of the photodetector. For instance,using a nanomesh or ultra-thin metal electrode design can effectively reduce light reflection,thereby improving the light absorption efficiency of the device [80].Secondly, the position and arrangement of the electrodes are crucial for the effectivecollection of carriers. In traditional planar electrode structures, carriers must travel throughthe entire active layer to be collected, which can lead to higher recombination losses.In contrast, in three-dimensional or grid electrode structures, the interface between theelectrodes and the active layer is closer to the carrier generation sites, which can significantlyreduce the carrier transport path, thereby decreasing recombination losses and improvingresponse speed.
