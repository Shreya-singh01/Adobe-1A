"Abstract: Laser-induced ﬂuorescence (LIF) has been a valuable analytical technique since the 1970sthat has only been made more useful through advances in other scientiﬁc ﬁelds such as biochemistry.Moreover, advances in laser and detector technology have seen a decrease in LIF detector costs and anincrease in their ease of use. These changes have allowed for LIF technology to be widely adopted forvarious sensor designs in combination with advanced instruments. With advances in biochemistrynecessitating the detection of complex metabolites, labelling with ﬂuorescent chemical reagents maybe necessary to improve detection sensitivity. Furthermore, advances made in ﬂuorescent labelingtechnologies have allowed for the use of LIF in the detection of nanoparticles as well as for imagingtechniques using nanoparticles as signal ampliﬁers. This technology has become invaluable in thedetection of environmental pollutants, monitoring of biological metabolites, biological imaging, andcancer diagnosis, making it one of the most valuable analytical science techniques currently available.",8.94,True,1,166.9149932861328,231.76736450195312,False,False,False,body

"Laser-induced ﬂuorescence (LIF) spectroscopy is a technique that can empower achemical analysis laboratory to easily monitor the concentration of inherently ﬂuorescentcompounds and enable the development of new analytical methods that utilize ﬂuorescentlabeling [1]. Fluorescence detection functions by shining light on a sample at the analyte’soptical excitation wavelength and collecting the light from the analyte at its emissionwavelength perpendicular to the incident beam. The incident beam can be produced froma variety of sources including lasers, light-emitting diodes, tungsten–halogen bulbs, andarc lamps (containing mercury, xenon, or deuterium). These light sources have their ownadvantages and disadvantages, and the intended use of the detector dictates which sourcecan be used [2]. LIF spectroscopy offers several advantages over absorption spectroscopy.First, LIF has excellent detection sensitivity because a signal is observed against a darkbackground. Second, the emitted radiation can be collected at various angles with respectto the collimated laser beam, making it possible to obtain two- and three-dimensionalimages. Third, LIF imaging of translucent and opaque materials is particularly attractivedue to the strength of the resonant absorption process compared with the non-resonantRayleigh techniques in Raman spectroscopy. Fourth, by dispersing the ﬂuorescence, it isalso possible to learn about the transitions from the excited state to various lower energylevels of the ﬂuorescent molecule. Fifth, because of the delay between the excitation anddetection events, it is possible to study the processes the excited molecule undergoes in theintervening time [3]. This technology has seen many improvements and novel uses overthe last couple of decades. As new LIF-based research and applications rise in numberevery year [4], the justiﬁcation for any science or engineering laboratory not having an LIFdetection system continues to dwindle. A pioneering LIF application can be found in theearly work by Hofzumahaus and Holland, wherein the measurement of tropospheric OHradicals achieved a detection limit of 8.2 × 106 •OH/cm3 [5].

"through a nozzle into a ﬂuorescence cell and irradiated by a pulsed frequency-doubled dyelaser. The laser wavelength was tuned to selectively excite the •OH radicals on a singlerovibronic transition at 308 nm. The OH-resonance ﬂuorescence, emitted mostly between307 and 311 nm, was detected by a gated photomultiplier/photon counter assembly.As synthetic biochemistry and biomedical engineering make scientiﬁc advances, therehas been a growing need for sensitive methods of detecting biological metabolites, proteins,endoplasmic reticulum membranes, living cells, cancers, and organelles [6–9]. Most tissuescontain several different ﬂuorescent compounds, which include the amino acid tryptophan,the oxidation-reduction mediator NADH, the connective components elastin and collagen,porphyrin, as well as pyridoxal acid. However, the amounts of ﬂuorophores are differentbetween normal and abnormal tissues. Their unenhanced autoﬂuorescence patterns seemcapable of detecting neoplasms [10]. Quantitatively, LIF is a powerful tool widely used inglycan analysis with ﬂuorophore-labeled carbohydrates where each species has a commonresponse factor. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), on the other hand,while revealing important structural information about individual analytes, generally havedifferent response factors for the quantitative analysis of different species. For improvedquantitation with ESI-MS, laser-induced ﬂuorescent images were collected at the Taylorcone of the electrospray interface, enabling simultaneous optical quantitative optical andqualitative MS detection of ﬂuorophore-labeled sugars. The limit of LIF detection was40 attomoles; the intra- and inter-day peak area reproducibilities were 4.2% and 6.8%,respectively [11]. Furthermore, the need extends to the detection of environmental con-taminants that have been found in foods through processing and packaging activities.Fluorescence detection is a popular technology of detecting contaminant molecules, asmany are either inherently ﬂuorescent or can be made to be ﬂuorescent through label-ing [12–15]. This technology is also popular for its cost effectiveness compared to otheradvanced technologies like mass spectrometry [16]. In addition, ﬂuorescence detectiondoes not suffer some of the issues that affect mass spectroscopy, such as the inability todistinguish between molecules (or fragments) with identical mass-to-charge ratios with-out capital investment on high-resolution mass spectrometers, difﬁculty with ionizingsamples to form molecular ions, and complicated troubleshooting that mass spectrometryinstrumentation can cause [16,17]. Furthermore, mass spectrometry is not necessarilythe best available technique for virological analysis because of the time-consuming andtedious image collection process. LIF is applicable to the visual classiﬁcation of viruses,reducing the time and costs for this analysis. Rossi et al. performed experimental tests inwhich different viruses were irradiated with a UV laser beam at 266 nm and the emissionspectra were recorded by a spectrometer. Their classiﬁcation techniques demonstrated thefeasibility of discriminating viruses. The development of a rapid virological analysis allowsfast responses to epidemiologic events, thus reducing their risks to public health. Moreover,a cost reduction translates to an increase in the number of sampling sites monitored, withpotential enhancement of prevention and control of disease spread [18]. All these scientiﬁcpapers contributed towards the ever rising number of LIF publications, based on the yearlystatistics retrieved from Google Scholar between 2001 and 2021, as shown in Figure 1.In this review, the development of LIF detector technology for biological, catalytic,chemical, environmental, enzymatic, radiological and toxicological sciences since 2010 isdescribed. Detection system designs are classiﬁed based on the excitation light source,molecular probes/tags [19,20], sample cell conﬁguration, and electrooptical detector spec-iﬁcations. Advanced technologies of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) andspectrometers based on cutting-edge quantum cascade (QC) and interband cascade (IC)lasers are accounted for a comprehensive review.",9.93,False,2,166.8459930419922,96.5963134765625,False,False,False,body

"LIF is a method of choice for real-time ﬁeld screening of residual organic contaminantsin ground water, undisturbed vadose, capillary fringe, and subsurface soils. The technologyis intended to provide highly detailed, qualitative to semiquantitative information aboutthe distribution of subsurface contamination that ﬂuoresces, such as petroleum productscontaining polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) [21]. Detection systems based on LIFcan be custom built in the laboratory from commercially available components that meetthe speciﬁc design needs of the researchers. Three-dimensional printed parts can be usedin conjunction with these components to signiﬁcantly reduce costs and construction timeof the bench-top system [22]. NASA has built a high-performance LIF instrument for thedetection of airborne formaldehyde [23]. Rotational-state speciﬁc excitation at 353 nm isachieved by using a compact ﬁber laser (10 mW output power), with a single-pass designfor stable signal response and a stand-alone data acquisition system. The accuracy ofreported mixing ratios of tropospheric formaldehyde is ±10% based on calibration againstIR and UV absorption of a primary HCHO standard. Precision at 1 Hz is typically betterthan 20% above 100 parts per trillion by volume (pptv), with uncertainty in the signalbackground contributing mostly to variability at low mixing ratios. The detection limit (fora signal-to-noise ratio of 2) is 36 parts per trillion (ppt), and the time response at typicalsample ﬂow rates is 0.19 s [24].An instrument was designed for LIF detection of NO2 to determine the peroxy nitrates,alkyl nitrates, hydroxyalkyl nitrates, and HNO3 total, attaining a detection limit of 90 ppt inﬁeld observations [25]. A single-photon LIF sensor was recently developed for atmosphericmeasurements of nitric oxide (NO) in the atmosphere. Rapid tuning of a narrow-band laseron and off of a rotationally resolved NO spectral feature near 215 nm and detection of thered-shifted ﬂuorescence provides for interference-free direct measurements of NO witha detection limit of 1 pptv for 1 s of integration, or 0.3 pptv for 10 s of integration. Theinstrument has been deployed on the NASA DC-8 aircraft and provided more than 140 hof NO measurements over 22 ﬂights autonomously [26]. Analysis of dissolved organicmatter (DOM) concentration and composition is essential for quantifying biological andchemical oxygen demand in natural waters; however, manual water sampling is costly andtime consuming over large areas. An airborne LIF light detection and ranging (LiDAR)system was designed to assess the DOM concentration of the Annapolis River and Basin(Nova Scotia, Canada) as well as three rivers and their estuaries (in Prince Edward Island,Canada). Two ﬂight missions were conducted in the summers of 2008 and 2009 and positivecorrelations were found with traditional sample collection [27].Fluorescent PAH molecules may be contained in non-aqueous phase liquids (NAPLs)including petroleum fuels/oils, coal tars, and creosotes.

"ﬂuorescence of an NAPL with depth provides rapid and cost-effective delineation of NAPL.A clear sapphire window is ﬁtted into the side of a direct probe that is pushed through thesoil column. As this sapphire-windowed probe is advanced steadily into the soil columnat approximately 2 cm/s, pulses of laser light are sent down via ﬁber optics to exit thewindow and shine onto the passing soil. Any resulting ﬂuorescence that comes back intothe window is brought up by a second ﬁber for data processing and analysis in real time.LIF systems can log up to 30 m below the ground surface, taking approximately 45 minfrom start to ﬁnish [28].There is always a need for forensic laboratories to conduct evidence analysis in a postblast scenario. The development of portable sensors for fast screening of crime scenes isrequired to reduce the number of evidences useful to be collected, optimization of timeand resources. A multispectral LIF imaging system is able to detect evidence of differentmaterials on very confusing areas at distances up to tens of meters. A short analysis time,but with sufﬁcient accuracy of forensic evidence at the original crime scene, was a mainrequirement in the system design. Plastics (polypropylene, polyethylene and polyester)were identiﬁed and their locations in the examined area were highlighted through dataprocessing. By proper choice of emission bands, the LIF imaging system can be used forthe rapid detection of other material classes (textiles, woods, and varnishes) [29].The capsid protein purity of adeno-associated virus (AAV) is considered a criticalquality attribute of gene therapy products. However, the viral capsid proteins are present inextremely low concentrations. A one-step denaturation and ﬂuorescence labeling procedurefor AAV capsid proteins (using the Chromeo™P503 dye) enabled the establishment ofa capillary electrophoresis-sodium dodecyl sulfate method with LIF for AAV detection.The method has been validated to be accurate and precise with a linear dynamic range of8.0 × 107–3.0 × 1011 vector genomes per mL (vg/mL). The detection limit and quantitationlimit were established to be 8.0 × 107 vg/mL and 4.2 × 108 vg/mL, respectively [30].LIF is also a very sensitive detection method in micro total analytical systems (µTAS)owing to the good monochromaticity, strong collimation and high optical density of diode-pumped solid-state lasers. Due to its important role in µTAS, different optical structurearrangements of LIF detection have undergone continuous development [31].",9.87,False,4,166.8459930419922,98.3773193359375,False,False,False,body

"Arc lamps are the most popular light sources used in ﬂuorescence detectors [32]. Arclamps, like other lamps, have the advantage that they offer a wide spectrum, which can beseparated by a monochromator to allow one lamp to be used in a variety of ﬂuorescenceapplications [33]. Arc lamps function by using high voltages to form a sustained arc ofelectrons between two plates [34]. The gas that is used to facilitate the arc of electrons iswhat gives the lamp its spectrum, as well as determining the stability of said spectrum [33].Unlike arc lamps, tungsten–halogen bulbs function by passing electricity along a wireof tungsten in the presence of a halogen gas [35]. This causes the tungsten to heat upand release gaseous tungsten, which then reacts with the halogen, producing light, beforeredepositing the tungsten onto the wire [36]. As the tungsten of these lamps needs toreach very high temperatures in order for it to function, they do not have a very long lifecompared to other light sources [37].Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are a light source of growing popularity owing totheir comparatively small size and low cost [38]. Unlike previously described lamps,multiple different colored LEDs are required in a ﬂuorimeter in order to cover the samewavelengths emitted by a lamp [39]. LEDs function by using running electricity through asemiconducting material (e.g., GaAs), which causes electrical holes to be ﬁlled, releasingenergy as light [40]. Additionally, the intensity of light offered by conventional LEDs islow compared to available lasers, despite both having similarly narrow spectra [41].LIF is one of the most sensitive detection methods. Lasers were ﬁrst utilized in ﬂuo-rescence detectors in 1968 when Richard Zare used a He-Ne laser to perform spectroscopyon gas-phase potassium molecules [42].

"with the other above-mentioned sources. Firstly, unlike lamps and LEDs, lasers producethin beams of light with photons moving in the same direction, and thus do not diminishin intensity as quickly as other light sources [43]. This allows for a longer distance coveredbetween the light source and sample without losing excitation light intensity by the inverse-square law [44]. Furthermore, like LEDs, lasers offer a very small selection of wavelengthsin the output beam, which negates the need for a monochromator which is necessary whenusing arc lamps [45]. Moreover, lasers can also be pulsed at very high frequencies to applyhigher intensity light as compared to continuous wave lasers, but at a frequency such thatthe ﬂuorophore can relax to its ground state before being excited again [46]. However, thishigher light intensity can cause photodegradation, which can negatively impact sensitivityas the ﬂuorophore molecules are degraded [46,47].LIF is an important technology for the detection of organic molecules as well asminerals on the surface of Mars [48]. Frequency multipliers of the Nd-YAG laser output(1064 nm) produce harmonic wavelengths that are suitable for ﬂuorescence excitation ofperchlorate (at 355 nm) and PAH (at 266 nm and 355 nm but not 532 nm) [48]. A LIF-baseddetection system was evaluated for the inﬂuence of time-resolved data on the biologicalagent classiﬁcation accuracy. A multi-wavelength sub-nanosecond laser source was usedto acquire spectral and time-resolved data from a standoff distance of 3.5 m from sevendifferent bacterial species and six types of oil. Classiﬁcation performed with a decision treealgorithm showed that accuracy was increased from 86% for spectral data only to morethan 92% when combined with time-resolved data [49].As real-time detection and monitoring of microbial contamination on solid surfacesis mandatory in a range of biomedical, safety and security applications, a LIDAR devicewas designed using the LIF method based on dual wavelength sensing with multispectralpattern recognition system. Microbial simulants (bacteria, bacterial spores, fungal conidiaand virus) were assessed and the spectra of dead versus living E. coli showed differences atvarious sensing wavelengths [50].A variant of LIF imaging of increasing interest is multiphoton microscopy. Thistechnique uses IR rather than visible or UV light in order to excite ﬂuorophores [51]. Thisis possible as the sum of the energies of the two (or more) IR photons (often of differentenergy) used can excite the ﬂuorophore [52]. While this would convolute LIF detection, itis preferred in imaging as IR light penetrates tissues deeper than visible and UV light [53].Moreover, the use of two IR photons excludes all ﬂuorophores other than the target thatwill ﬂuoresce. It allows for multidimensional imaging, as two laser excitation beams mustcross at a spatial point to induce ﬂuorescence [54].",9.96,False,5,166.8459930419922,98.25563049316406,False,False,False,body

"As not every molecule is highly ﬂuorescent, especially under visible light, moleculesmust be labeled with ﬂuorescent tags in order to detect them [55]. A wide selection ofﬂuorescent tag products are commercially available, including labeled antibodies andconjugates, as well as reactive dyes and labeling kits. Over thirty reactive dyes have beensynthesized for LIF applications across the visible, far-red and near-IR spectra. Their highperformance offers superior brightness, photostability, and solubility [56].The most notable examples of LIF applications in biology is tagging proteins withgreen ﬂuorescent protein (GFP) and its many derivatives [57]. Many proteins can be taggedwith this protein by adding a DNA sequence encoding GFP in frame with the proteinto be tagged; the resultant fusion protein will be ﬂuorescent, with minimal impact onprotein function [58]. Other common dyes such as ﬂuorescein, rhodamine, and variousAlexa Fluors must be chemically bonded to their targets, which makes them only viablewhen labeling can be done outside a biological system [59–61]. When this technology isapplied to antibody labeling, cells and tissues can be ﬂuorescently labeled based on theexpression of a target protein [62]. Antibody labelling can be invaluable in the researchof drug delivery vehicles, as their path to the target tissue can be monitored [63].

"can allow researchers to modify their targeting methods or delivery vehicles based on theresults from the ﬂuorescence experiments.In addition to conventional ﬂuorophore labeling, advances in nanoscience have al-lowed for LIF labeling with ﬂuorescent nanoparticles called quantum dots (QDs) [64]. QDsare nanoparticles made of semiconducting materials whose size and material compositiondictate its ﬂuorescence properties [65]. The mechanism of QD ﬂuorescence differs fromconventional ﬂuorophores as they utilize quantum conﬁnement in order to create band-gaps that produce ﬂuorescence [66]. Quantum conﬁnement occurs when the diameter of ananoparticle approaches the de Broglie wavelength of the electron wave function [67]. Apotential well is formed, and the band gap becomes proportional to the particle size [68].QDs have several advantages over more conventional probes, mainly their high quantumyield, broad absorption spectrum, narrow and size-tunable emission wavelengths, as wellas superior durability especially to photobleaching [69].QDs can be categorized into three types: core-type, core-shell, and alloyed [70]. Core-type QDs can be distinguished by the fact that they are composed of a single material,such as CdTe [71]. Core-shell QDs are distinguished from core-type as they contain twodistinct layers of semiconductors, with the outermost layer having a higher band gap thanthe core [72]. Core-shell QDs have several advantages compared to core-type QDs, mostnotably their increased quantum yield, stability, and adjustable wavefunction engineer-ing [73,74]. Alloy-type QDs, like core-shell QDs, consist of two different semiconductors;but rather than being in distinct layers, they are alloyed together, forming a homogenousnanoparticle [75]. These QDs are easier to produce than core-shell QDs and offer simi-lar advantages over core-type QDs [76]. In addition to being distinct types, they can becombined into QDs with distinct layers, one or more of which are alloyed [77].As most QDs contain cadmium and another heavy metal, they pose some risk of heavymetal poisoning when introduced into the body; thus there has been growing interest inless toxic forms of QDs for use in imaging [78]. Some examples of QD semiconductorswhich contain comparatively less toxic heavy metals are InP, CuInS2, Ag2S, ZnS-AgInS2,silicon, and graphene [79]. These materials, although less toxic than CdTe, do have sometoxicity, thus requiring extensive toxicity tests before they can be approved for medicaluse [80].In addition to the ﬂuorophore action that QDs provide, nanostructures such asnanoparticles and nanorods can also serve to quench the ﬂuorescence of other ﬂuo-rophores [81]. This can be useful as a method for the detection and imaging of compoundsthat would otherwise have low ﬂuorescence intensity due to the molecular propertiesor a low ﬂuorophore concentration. However, the use of nanostructures can increasetheir intensity [81] or produce a higher ﬂuorescence output in imaging [82]. In additionto the more common metal or metal oxide nanoparticle enhancement, research has alsoshown that carbon-based nanoparticles show similar enhancement, which could prove tobe useful, and as such nanoparticles may be more suitable for use in vivo compared withother nanostructures [83].The most logical application for these ﬂuorophores is in combination with targetingmolecules such as antibodies and aptamers [84]. This can be seen in Santana et al., in whichresearchers were able to attach a ZnS-AgInS2 QD to an anti-vascular endothelial growthfactor (VEGF) receptor antibody [85]. The goal of this was to target brain cancer cells sothat the tumors could be imaged and treated by blocking VEGF receptor activity with theantibody conjugate [85]. Results showed a statistically signiﬁcant decline in cell viabilityof U87 cancer cells tested compared to the HEK 293T cell control [85]. Other research byDobhal et al. focused on imaging of exosomes, vesicles released from cells, as they are usefulas biomarkers [86]. Speciﬁcally, by attaching an InP-ZnS QD-anti-CD63 antibody conjugateto CD63 (a protein known to be expressed on the surface of exosomes), the authors wereable to image the exosomes for use as biomarkers of complex cell processes [86].",9.9,False,6,166.8459930419922,98.31621551513672,False,False,False,body

Capillary electrophoresis(CE) can be coupled with sheath-ﬂow LIF detection to offer outstanding sensitivity forbiochemical analysis. In CE-LIF, a plug of sample is electrophoretically driven downa fused silica capillary by applying a high voltage between the inlet and outlet ends.Molecules of different sizes and charge states travel at different velocities down throughthe narrow capillary channel.

"Microﬂuidic chips/devices for CE analysis were conventionally constructed with LIFdetection in an orthogonal optical arrangement. Sensitive detection could be achieved bydetecting the ﬂuorescence light emitted in the microchannel through the sidewall of the chipto reduce background noise due to scattered light from the excitation beam. A ﬂuorescencecollection angle of 45 degrees in the chip plane could yield better signal-to-noise ratios asthe scattered light intensity decreased to only 1/38 of that obtained at an angle of 90 degrees.A detection limit (S/N = 3) of 1.1 pM ﬂuorescein was obtained, which is comparable tothat of optimized confocal LIF systems [90].

The lens-ﬁlter layer enablessimultaneous excitation rejection and ﬂuorescence enhancement to couple ﬂuorescencefrom a microﬂuidic channel to a surface photodetector [91]. A strategy combining minimalsystem design and low-cost system construction was adopted to achieve instrumentalminiaturization. The total size of the microﬂuidic CE-LIF bioanalyzer was minimized to90 mm length × 75 mm width × 77 mm height and the instrument cost was reduced toUSD500. After attaining a detection limit of 1.0 nM sodium ﬂuorescein, this bioanalyzerwas applied to colorectal cancer diagnosis by the polymerase chain reaction-restrictionfragment length polymorphism method [92]. Another LIF detector was developed for pes-ticide residues based on a microﬂuidic sensor array, utilizing a spectral recognition methodfor unsupervised pattern recognition to analyze the characteristic ﬁngerprint-like ﬂuores-cent spectral patterns [93]. The detector system responded to pesticide concentrations of10 ppb [93].Beam divergence at the exit end of the ﬁrst optical ﬁber attenuates the power densityof optical excitation, and coupling at the entrance end of the second optical ﬁber makes itinefﬁcient to collect the ﬂuorescence light from a microﬂuidic chip. The excitation powerand coupling efﬁciency can be signiﬁcantly increased by using an on-chip micro-lens systemwith integrated optical ﬁbers, specially designed by Code V® lens design software [94].Numerical simulations can be conducted to optimize the distance between all opticalelements. The micro-lens was produced using direct lithography of SU-8 photoresist [94].The emitted light can be collimated by an objective and passed through a variety of opticalﬁlters in order to increase the spectral selectivity of the detection method [4,94,95]. Amodular microﬂuidic CE system with LIF detection was constructed to analyze aminoacids (valine, serine, alanine, glycine, glutamic acid, and aspartic acid) in borate bufferedsolutions at concentrations ranging from 10 mM to 50 mM (pH 9.5).

"Usually, LIF systems are constructed in research labs to detect chemical analytes inbiological samples, using a low-power continuous-wave laser as the excitation source.However, as the luminosity of emitted light is often very low, methods of amplifyingthe signal are necessary [97]. The most common method used to amplify low luminositylight signals into an electric signal is the photomultiplier tube (PMT) [98]. When photonsinteract with a series of dynodes of an increasingly positive potential within the vacuumtubes in a PMT, electrons are being ejected, which will then be multiplied, producing a100-million-fold increase in signal strength [99], resulting in an exponentially ampliﬁedsignal [100].There have been several advances in PMT technology since their development byKubetsky in 1930 [101,102]. One of the ﬁrst such advancements was the development ofthe avalanche photodiode (APD) in the 1950s by Nishizawa [103]. An APD differs from aPMT in that the former utilizes a single ampliﬁcation event in a diode, which allows thedetector to be signiﬁcantly smaller, but at the cost of signal-to-noise ratio [104]. As a resultof their very small size compared to PMT, APD are very commonly utilized in optical ﬁberbased detectors [105].The most signiﬁcant advancement was the development of silicon photomultipliers(SiPM) [106]. SiPMs are a combination of APD and PMT, where the electrons are multipliedsimilarly to an APD but ampliﬁed similarly to a PMT [107]. This difference leads to a morecompact, cost effective, and resilient tool that uses lower operating voltages [108].Two single-mode optical ﬁbers can be framed up in a V-shaped conﬁguration fortransmitting the excitation light and detecting the induced ﬂuorescence to construct ascanning LIF detection system for microﬂuidic CE analysis [109].

Thesespectrometers offer an cost-efﬁcient module for both independent researchers and Op-tical Emission Spectroscopy manufacturers of analytical instruments, who do not wantto sacriﬁce performance and robustness for compactness [110]. Either a PMT, chargecoupled device (CCD), or APD can be used as the detector. A high-speed APD providesresponsivity between 400 and 1000 nm, as well as extremely fast rise and fall times at allwavelengths. The responsivity of the device is independent of modulation frequency up toabout 800 MHz. The detector chip is hermetically sealed behind a ﬂat glass window in amodiﬁed TO-18 package, affording a useful diameter of 0.5 mm as the photosensitive sur-face. It is also packaged in a TO-18 lightpipe, which allows efﬁcient coupling of light to thedetector from an optical ﬁber up to 0.25 mm in diameter [111]. The detector output signalis acquired by a current-to-voltage conversion circuit, amplifying circuit, and peak-holdingcircuit. The digital peak signal can then be processed by a computer [44].A virtual instrument system based on LabVIEW was reported for the design andoperation of LIF detection. This system achieves synchronous control of equipment and ac-quisition of real-time ﬂuorescence data by communication with a computer via GPIB, USB,RS232 and parallel ports.

"When the LIF technology was initially developed, the instruments were manufacturedin laboratories [113]. When the technology was growing in popularity in the 1970s, it wasvery difﬁcult to incorporate lasers in commercially available LIF detectors at the time [114].However, with the advent of viable lasers, commercial LIF detectors were put on the marketby several leading scientiﬁc instrument companies.The SCIEX 800 Plus pharmaceutical analysis system comprises a 488-nm laser modulewith an output power of 3 mW. With LIF detection, low ﬂuorescence emission lightintensities are measured against a dark background. These intensities are easily inﬂuencedby changes in the optical path. Due to this uncertainty, LIF detector response is annotatedin relative ﬂuorescent units (RFU). A calibration is performed to correct for these changesby using ﬂuorescein (1 × 10−7 M in water). The LIF detector system is designed to guidethe ﬂuorescence emission light via a ﬁber optic cable to the photomultiplier detector.Flashlight can be used to verify ﬁber optic output. To check noise, drift and baselinestability, ﬂuorescein solution is run with laser off for 5 min followed by laser on for 5 min.A ﬂat baseline with a small step increment of RFU at 5 min should verify good operationof LIF [115].Planar LIF is an optical imaging technique based upon ﬂuorescence emitted fromchemical species excited by planar laser light to measure instant whole-ﬁeld concentrationor temperature maps. Essentially a sheet of laser light is passed through a ﬂow ﬁeld, andthe subsequent ﬂuorescence emission is captured on a 2D CCD imaging sensor, imagingﬁber optics, or time-gated digital camera to acquire spatial information. Planar LIF can beused for a range of concentration, pressure, temperature and velocity measurements indifferent liquid and gaseous ﬂow environments. Current applications are found in sprays,combustion diagnostics, ﬂame radicals, process engineering, biomedical engineering, andﬂuid mechanics/dynamics research [116]. In studies involving mixing of ﬂuids, oneof the ﬂuids is marked with the dye tracer compound, whereas the other is fresh ﬂuid.A laser light sheet illuminates a thin plane in the ﬂow and the tracer absorbs some ofthe excitation light to emit ﬂuorescence. Commonly used dyes for measurements inliquids are rhodamine 6G (for concentration measurements), rhodamine B (for temperaturemeasurements).

"There have been several advances in LIF technology since their inception in the 1970s.One of the most notable improvements came with the advances in laser diode (also referredto as semiconductor lasers) technology [120]. The ﬁrst laser diodes were bulkier, lesspowerful, and did not operate well at room temperature as compared to more moderndiodes [121]. These advancements have made diode lasers both cheaper and smallercompared to more conventional gas laser technologies [122].In addition to the advancements in diode technology, the use of ﬁber optics hasalso been a great improvement to LIF technologies [123]. Optical ﬁbers use total internalreﬂection along a very thin glass conduit of high-refractive index (>1.480) as a waveguidein order to transport light signals across large distances without losing signal strength [124].Due to the waveguide mitigating any signiﬁcant loss of light intensity that occurs overlong distances of propagation, lower intensity ﬂuorescence can be detected [125]. Opticalﬁbers are commonly implemented into ﬂuorescence detectors either after the light source,before the detector, or both [126]. Designs that implement optical ﬁbers do offer distinctadvantages over those that do not, although there are disadvantages that prevent themfrom being used in every system. Most notable of these disadvantages are the increase incost compared to systems that do not use ﬁber optics, and the fragile nature of these glassﬁbers if not physically protected by a cladding [127,128]. However, when implementedproperly, optical ﬁbers allow for distinct separation of both the light source and detectorfrom the sample, allowing for less stray light in a compact design [129].In addition to advances in available parts, other advances in technology, especiallyseparation technologies, have necessitated integration with LIF detection [130]. Commontechnologies include, but are not limited to, high-performance liquid chromatography, CE,microﬂuidics, and ﬂow cytometry [131–135]. Most of these integrations simply involvethe replacement of a standard cuvette with a ﬂow cell (or in the case of CE, a section ofoptical window along the capillary) after the separation [136].

"In recent years, LIBS has been widely used in many ﬁelds of scientiﬁc research forchemical element detection. In LIBS, a sample is excited with intense laser pulses and theemitted light is analyzed, which generally falls in the visible or infrared spectral region.LIBS is ideal for sample analysis as it does not require sample preparation, and generallyremoves less than 1 µg of material during laser ablation [142]. LIBS is fast, causes littlesample damage (ablation crater radius < 70 µm), can be applied on-line, and applicable inremote ﬁeld locations [143]. The LIBS plasma (or ablation vapor plume) was produced bya Q-switched Nd:YAG laser at 1064 nm, and the resultant radiation was detected using aPaschen–Runge spectrometer equipped with photomultipliers [144]. The photomultipliersignals were processed by a fast gateable multichannel integrator for the simultaneousanalysis of different elements [145]. LIBS is often combined with molecular LIF to studyplasma-borne molecules [146]. The experiments are normally performed in air at atmo-spheric pressure. When excited by a nanosecond optical parametric oscillator laser tuned at283.31 nm, emission from Pb atoms was then observed at 405.78 nm with a detection limitof 180 ppb over 100 laser shots. In the double pulse resonant LIBS system, a wavelength-tunable laser was divided into reﬂection and transmission beams by using a beam splitter.The reﬂected laser pulse was ﬁrstly used to ablate the sample, and then the transmis-sion laser pulse was used to resonantly excite the target atoms in the vapor plume [147].Femtosecond LIBS for in situ ammonia (NH3) measurements was demonstrated when afemtosecond laser beam (λ = 800 nm) was focused at NH3 molecules, photolysis generatedelectronic-excited NH fragments with subsequent ﬂuorescence detection at 336 nm to attaina lower limit of 205 ppm [148]. Data from single-line LIBS for seven major rock-forming ele-ments (Al, Ca, Fe, Mg, Si, Na and K) were collected to produce pseudo-logs of geochemicaldata that are representative of stratigraphy [149]. The optimal LIF excitation locations werethe center of the plasma for Fe, but the periphery for Cr and Ni. By focusing an excitationlaser beam at the optimal locations, not only excitation efﬁciency, but also the accuracy ofquantitative LIBS-LIF analysis, were improved compared to those with excitation at theplasma center in conventional LIBS-LIF [150]. Ground-state Co atoms in LIBS plasma wereresonantly excited by a tunable laser at 304.40 nm. The LIF detection limit was 0.8 µg/g insteel matrix [151]. LIBS-LIF was validated to enhance the spectral intensity of uranium inores and eliminate spectral interference. In contrast with atomic lines, uranium ion linesare more suitable for determination of uranium. A detection limit of 35 µg/g was achieved,demonstrating the excellent potential of LIBS-LIF in the exploration of uranium in naturalresources [152]. LIBS-LIF could also eliminate spectral interference effectively and improvethe ability of LIBS to detect trace heavy metals (0.6 ppm Pb) in soil [153]. Utilizing thecombination of carbon in steel industry and nitrogen in ambient gas to generate carbon-nitrogen (CN) radicals by LIBS resonantly, the excited CN radicals could be stimulated bylaser (λex = 421.60 nm) to emit ﬂuorescence (λem = 388.34 nm) [154]. Remote detection ofatmospheric haloalkanes of interest at a high altitude poses considerable technological orlogistic challenges. Laser sources could be used to remotely excite and fragment the targethaloalkane molecules, followed by their identiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation using opticalemission [155].

"One of the most important aspects in controlling a viral outbreak is monitoring thenumber of infected people in a population.

"Metal oxide nanoparticles (MONPs)—Al2O3, CeO2, CuO, Fe3O4, Mn3O4, TiO2, ZnO,ZrO2—represent a ﬁeld of materials chemistry that has attracted considerable interest in thelast couple of decades due to their industrial and technological applications [162]. MONPsare employed as biomedical materials in biosensing, dentistry, diagnosis, immunotherapy,regenerative medicine, tissue therapy, and wound healing. Their surface properties canbe tailor-made by introducing ligand functionality that provides target speciﬁcity, forexample, the addition of antibodies to their surfaces with speciﬁcity for a target cell [163].Advances in the development of functionalized MONPs are witnessed over a broad rangeof applications including biomedical imaging, cancer treatment, catalysis, chemical sensing,drug delivery, theranostics, and treatment of wastewater containing heavy metals [164,165].In addition, nanoparticles can effectively be combined with antibiotic drugs because it iseasier for the nanoparticles to enter bacterial cells compared with antibiotic drugs alone, asnanoparticles are endocytosed and can be functionalized to target speciﬁc cells, whereasthe drugs alone passively defuse into cells [166]. Supposedly, nanoparticles are able toparticipate in subcellular reactions because their size is similar to biological molecules. Forinstance, ZnO nanoparticles have been found to inhibit Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positivebacteria) cells. It is well-known that they have ability to penetrate the Pseudomonas aerugi-nosa (Gram-negative bacteria) and S. aureus (Gram-positive bacteria) cells [167]. As mostcell membranes are negatively charged, it is postulated that positively charged nanopar-ticles have a higher afﬁnity for bacteria. However, their antifungal, antimicrobial andantiviral properties come along with biotoxicology [167]. Exposure to Al2O3 nanoparticlesmay result in adverse health consequences of disturbed redox homeostasis, hepatocellulartoxicity, neurodegeneration, and DNA damage [168]. Furthermore, PbO nanoparticles aregraded as toxic and dangerous for the environment and human health [169]. The greatersurface area per mass of MONPs renders these nanoparticles biologically more active [170].Public health concerns about their unintended release in the environment are triggering theneed for a better understanding of their potential hazards to humans, and it is imperativeto assess their eco-toxicological impact on aquatic eco-systems. MONPs are reported tohave wide-ranging antimicrobial activities and be potent against bacteria, viruses, andprotozoans. Normally, smaller nanoparticles have higher antibacterial activity and are moretoxic (than big nanoparticles) because their larger surface area-to-volume ratio enhancedproduction of reactive oxygen species. These oxygen species can be produced by nanopar-ticles through a variety of mechanisms including surface-catalyzed photodecompositionof O2, Fenton-like reactions, and reactions with organic molecules on the nanoparticlesurfaces [171].

"A predominant mechanism leading to toxicity involves damage to proteins, cell mem-branes and DNA [173]. Benchmark dose analysis is an effective tool to rank sensitivityand toxicity across MONPs. Speciﬁcally, bronchial (BEAS-2B) and alveolar epithelial cells(A549) are exposed to a concentration range (0.4–100 µg/mL) of aqueous MONP suspen-sion. Eight toxicity endpoints representing the integrity of lysosomal/cell membrane,oxidative stress level, glutathione based detoxiﬁcation (glutathione S-transferase), oxida-tive metabolism (cytochrome P450), alteration of the mitochondrial membrane potential,alteration of phase II antioxidative enzyme (NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase), and denovo DNA synthesis can be determined. The sensitivity/toxicity decreases in the fol-lowing order: ZnO > CuO > TiO2 > ZrO2 > CeO2 when lung bronchial cells are exposedto these nanoparticles [174]. Algorithmic examination of MONPs by categorization intotoxicologically distinct clusters has divided them into sub-classes based on their dose–response-recovery similarity. Fe2O3, SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles showed signs of elevatedimmune system activity and cell membrane damage; ZnO and CeO2 nanoparticles ex-hibited comparatively reduced toxicity across all ﬁve responses [175]. The potential toxiceffect of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles on various cell lines has centered oncellular and molecular mechanisms in animal models [176]. A high dose of biologicallyand chemically synthesized CuO nanoparticles induced adverse effects on hepatic, renaland splenic tissues. At the same dose level, the biologically synthesized CuO nanoparticlesevoked more potent toxic effects than the chemically synthesized ones [177]. Particularly, ithas been conﬁrmed that MONPs may induce serious genotoxic effects on various biolog-ical targets. Given the difﬁculties of experimental assays for estimating the genotoxicityof MONPs on diverse biological targets, development of alternative methodologies iscrucial to establish their level of safety. In silico modelling approaches, such as quantita-tive structure–toxicity relationships based on perturbation theory machine learning, arenow considered a promising solution for predicting their genotoxicity rapidly and cost-efﬁciently [178]. When a model of luminescent bacteria, Vibrio ﬁscheri, was employed to testthe acute toxicity, the median effective concentration were 12 mg L−1 for ZnO nanoparticlesand 119 mg L−1 for CuO nanoparticles. For binary nanoparticle mixtures, the combinedeffect was synergistic revealing a complex pattern of interactions [179].Various antitoxic strategies, involving coatings and surface treatments, are emergingto decrease the harmful results while maintaining the favorable properties of MONPs [180].Mohanan et al. recommends adopting surface functionalization strategies for reducingtoxic response of ZnO nanoparticles in various applications [181]. Different strategiesof surface modiﬁcation and functionalization of colloidal ZnO nanoparticles have beenreported to lower their toxicity [182]. However, their surface chemistry is not as establishedas that of silica and alumina and modiﬁcation of ZnO nanoparticle surface area couldlead to release of Zn2+ ions that enhance ROS production. Fe2O3 nanoparticles can becoated with tartaric/adipic acid with potential for use as oral iron supplements [183].Different coatings (dextran, chitosan, polyethylene glycol, carboxy-silane, and silica) canaffect the toxicity elicited by super-paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles in developingzebraﬁsh (Danio rerio). Ranging from embryotoxicity parameters (survival, hatching rate,and anatomical malformations) to behavioral patterns (locomotion during the explorationof a new environment, thigmotaxis, and the escape response to an aversive stimulus), thetoxic effect depends on the physical size, hydrodynamic diameters, and zeta potential ofthe coated nanoparticles [184]. Mn3O4 nanoparticles can be doped with Zn, Cu or Cr toregulate the Fermi energy level far away from the valence band energy, thus generating alower amount of •OH and hence reducing the toxicity [185].In addition to toxicity [186], MONPs can impose rather unexpected but quite sig-niﬁcant effects on the structure and activity of biochemicals adsorbed on their surfaces.Understanding of the interaction of nanoparticles with biomolecules (such as ZnO withcysteine thiol groups in proteins) [187,188] is very important, as it can help better designnanocomposites for applications in diagnostics, drug delivery, cell monitoring, and sensors.It is well documented that protein adsorption is the ﬁrst process that occurs upon implanta-",9.68,False,13,166.93600463867188,98.36289978027344,False,False,False,body

"tion of a biomaterial into the physiological environment. Hence, human cells do not contactthe biomaterial directly, but interact with the adsorbed protein layer. The orientation, con-formation and packing arrangement of proteins are controlled by their tertiary structures inrelation to active sites at the nanoparticle surface. For instance, the decrease in ﬂuorescenceintensity caused by collisional quenching, as revealed by the Stern–Volmer plots, indicatedan effective static quenching process by TiO2 nanoparticles whereas SnO2 nanoparticleshad a lower quenching efﬁciency for bovine serum albumin ﬂuorescence [189]. CeO2nanoparticles triggered the transition of hen egg white lysozyme secondary structure fromα-helix to β-sheet and induced the hydrophobic region of lysozyme to become exposedto the solvent [190]. They also interact with bovine serum albumin with minor confor-mational changes in the biomolecular structure [191]. MONPs all interacted with thephosphate backbone of DNA, but exhibited different DNA adsorption afﬁnity [192,193].Some adsorbed DNA without quenching the ﬂuorescence, while others strongly quenchedadsorbed ﬂuorophores. They also displayed different afﬁnity toward anions as probed bydesorption of DNA as a signaling molecule [194].Surface modiﬁcation with organic dyes, molecular ﬂuorophores, and ﬂuorescent la-bels/probes made MONPs one of the most useful tools that chemistry has provided tobiomedical research, enabling the intracellular monitoring of targeted species by ﬂuores-cence lifetime imaging microscopy for various medical and biological purposes [195]. Itallows for upconversion to theranostics that unite diagnostic and therapeutic applicationsto form a single agent, allowing for diagnosis, drug delivery and treatment responsemonitoring [196]. Using the ﬂuorescence lifetime difference exhibited by native doxoru-bicin (∼1 ns) compared to conjugated doxorubicin (∼4.6 ns), the intracellular release ofconjugated doxorubicin was in situ monitored in H1299 lung cancer cells with time [197].Environmental sensitivity of the ﬂuorescence lifetime offers insights into the local envi-ronment of a nanoparticle or its interaction with surrounding biomolecules [198]. Titania(TiO2) and zirconia (ZrO2) serve as useful models for metal-oxide nanoparticles due to theiridentical stoichiometry, comparable acid/base behavior (surface hydroxyl groups’ pointof zero zeta potential = 5.8 and 6.7) and similar refractive indices (2.5 and 2.2, comparedwith 1.7 for alumina Al2O3). Fluorescent magnetic Eu3+-doped gadolinium oxide (Gd2O3)nanoparticles were successfully fabricated for biomedical applications [199]. Luminescentbehaviors were different between the pristine and modiﬁed europium-doped lutetium-oxide (Eu:Lu2O3) nanoparticles due to the inﬂuence of surface ligands or silver (Ag) on theiremission properties [200]. The ﬂuorescence lifetime (τ) is expressed as τ0 = 1/(Γ + Γm + knr)where Γ is radiative decay, knr is the non-radiative decay rate and subscript m denotesmetal, while the quantum efﬁciency of a scintillator material in the presence of a nearbymetal Q0 is expressed as Q0 = (Γ + Γm)/(Γ + ΓM + knr) and it indicates the possibility tosimultaneously decrease the decay time by 14% and increase the luminescence intensityby introducing Γm. Attachment of GFP molecules to TiO2 and cadmium oxide (CdO) wasinvestigated with time correlated single photon counting [201]. Time-resolved experimentsshow that the τ of GFP molecules bound to MONPs got shortened by 43% and 22% for TiO2and CdO, respectively, due to photoinduced electron transfer caused by the interactionof GFP molecules (donor) and MONPs (acceptor). Addition of polystyrene nanoparticles(n = 1.59) to an aqueous solution of the common ﬂuorescence dye molecule, Alexa 430,with a low quantum yield, led to a signiﬁcant enhancement in quantum yield and anassociated increase of the ﬂuorescent lifetime by up to 55% [202]. The increased quantumyield could be attributed to the hydrophobic effect on the structure of water (n = 1.33) inthe boundary layer around the polystyrene particles in suspension. Research into organicdye-sensitized solar cells was reinvigorated by the improvement of organic dye sensitizersdesigned to have electron donor and electron acceptor motifs located at opposite ends of themolecule that were connected through a π-bridge motif. Certain organic dyes were foundto prevent injected electrons within the titania conduction band from being interceptedby the oxidized redox species [203]. Structurally, the D35 dye contains a triphenylaminedonor motif, a thiophene π-bridge, and a cyanoacrylic acid acceptor motif [203].

"D35 dye is bound to the titania nanoparticle surface at full coverage, the butoxyl groupsform a steric barrier at the electrode/electrolyte interface, inhibiting recombination. Thebutoxyl groups also prevent dye molecules from aggregating to result in shorter excitedstate lifetimes.There has been an increase in the use of MONPs in the ﬂuorescent detection of othermolecules, which in many cases can be altered and used as a means of detecting thenanoparticles themselves [204]. For instance, Venkatesan et al. [205] attempted to use ZnOnanoparticles as a means of detecting picric acid and found that their ﬂuorescence increaseddramatically. Thus, by extension, picric acid can be used to detect ZnO nanoparticles [205].Similarly, by attaching a silane linker and the ﬂuorescent dye to TiO2 nanoparticles forcell imaging, Kokot et al. [206] found this strategy to be applicable to detection of thenanoparticles in water samples. Finally, Zhou et al. [207,208] used ﬂuorescently labelledDNA aptamers for the detection of speciﬁc species (e.g., Ochratoxin A and Aﬂatoxin B) infood samples. In their work, the aptamers were not chemically bonded to nanoparticles,making them easily detached in the presence of the target species as the three dimensionalshape assumed by the aptamers allowed them to overcome their adsorption onto thenanoparticles, resulting in a lower ﬂuorescence quenching effect for the development ofa sensitive detection method. Our laboratory has developed a similar detection methodfor TiO2 nanoparticles involving coating with ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) labelledanti-dopamine DNA aptamers, as illustrated in Figure 3. In this method, ﬂuorescentlylabeled aptamers are adsorbed onto nanoparticles, unbound aptamers are removed, andbound aptamers are removed by adding their target, separated, and detected by LIF inorder to determine the concentration of nanoparticles in the sample.",9.88,False,15,167.26499938964844,98.24498748779297,False,False,False,body

The advances in laser, de-tector, ﬁber optics, and ﬂuorescent labeling technologies have transformed a techniquethat was once difﬁcult to use, and limited in its scope, into one of the most prominentdetection and imaging techniques. In addition, as the ﬁelds of biology and biochemistryhave advanced, the needs for ﬂuorescence detection has dramatically increased, furtherincreasing demand for LIF. Moreover, the use of nanoparticles in these ﬁelds have providedmethods of detecting nanoparticles by LIF, something which will become more necessaryas MONPs are found in increasing quantities in the environment [209].
