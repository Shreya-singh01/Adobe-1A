"SUMMARYOrganometal halide perovskite has aroused extensive interest dueto its high absorption coefﬁcient and ﬂexible synthetic strategyfor fabricating sensitive and low-cost photodetectors. Neverthe-less, obtaining large and ordered orientation perovskite grain,developing enhanced optical absorption, and restraining defectstates of grain boundaries are still open and challenging processes.Here, we report a ﬂexible hierarchical architecture to promote graingrowth and absorption strength. Therein, graphene and its deriva-tives are adopted to produce enlarged grain via an in situ hot-cast-ing scheme. The surface plasmon resonance effect of highly conduc-tive reduced graphene oxide-silver (Ag-rGO) nanoparticles isintroduced to improve perovskite absorbance, enhancing respon-sivity by nearly four orders of magnitude to 13 AW1. Meanwhile,density functional theory calculations and ﬁnite-difference time-domain analysis conﬁrm the absorption enhancement and effectiveseparation of the photogenerated carriers.

"According to the critical photoelectric mechanisms of the photovoltaic effect,photoconductive effect, photothermoelectric effect, and bolometric effect,1,2 pho-todetectors monitor the change of light signals mainly via the photocurrent effect,which responds to weak light intensity, even single photon. It has been widelyapplied in military detection, night vision, industrial non-destructive detection,remote sensing, and so forth.3 As a fashionable photodetector, the gain mechanismsof the photocurrent rely on ﬁne crystal quality, high light-absorbing capacity, lowinterfacial trap states, and other gain architectures. Organolead triiodide perovskiteis an ideal material because of its large light absorption coefﬁcient,4 long carrier life-time,5 and low cost.6,7 Up to now, the hybrid perovskite has been widely applied inthe ﬁelds of solar cells,8 light-emitting diodes,9 and photodetectors.10 These robustindustrializations beneﬁt from the ﬂexible synthetic strategies of high-quality perov-skite ﬁlms, such as the one-step, two-step, and anti-solvent methods. However,these methods have always existed with many unsolved problems, such as surfaceor grain boundary point defects, trap defects, and incompetent light absorption.To eliminate defects and harvest a high-quality hybrid perovskite ﬁlm, an orderly lat-tice scheme, passivation strategy, and energy-efﬁcient architectures (surface plas-mon resonance [SPR] effect) are frequently applied in the preparation process.Thereinto, coordinate bonding, ionic bonding, and robust energy conversion arecommonly used to deactivate the defect, passivating induced deep-level traps.11,12",7.74,False,2,57.656700134277344,497.7928771972656,False,False,False,body

"Upgrading light absorption has always been a key consideration for photodetectors.Metal nanoparticles (Ag, Au) could develop an SPR effect, increasing light absorp-tion due to local enhancement of the electromagnetic ﬁeld.13,14 However, hybridperovskite photodetectors based on pure perovskites demonstrate low perfor-mance due to low carrier mobility originating from a high density of the grain bound-ary accompanied by abundant trap states. Hence, a light-absorbing material withhigh mobility was expected to be an active channel for transferring carriers, resultingin high responsivity. 2D materials are thought to be an ideal strategy to enhance theperformance of photodetectors.15–17 As a typical healing therapy of mobility engi-neering, graphene has an sp2-hybridized hexagonal carbon atom lattice. It pos-sesses a unique potential for electronics transport,18 which is one of the mostcompetitive materials for being used as the channel in the photodetector. Graphenecould rely on the strength of ultrahigh carrier mobility and ﬂexible van der Waalsepitaxy, contributing to the high photoelectric conversion efﬁciency. Graphenealso facilitates crystallization and carrier separation for hybrid perovskites, furtherdeveloping a high graphene/perovskite assembling detector performance.10,19,20",7.67,False,3,57.65669250488281,103.26698303222656,False,False,False,body

"Fabrication proceduresThe graphene/MAPbI3/Ag-rGO photodetector is fabricated as follows (Figure 1).Firstly, the large-area and high-mobility graphene was prepared via a conventionalCVD method (Figures S1 and S2; Notes S1 and S2).21 Then, the graphene was trans-ferred onto a hydrophilic SiO2/n-Si substrate by wet transfer method after ultraviolet(UV)-ozone cleaning (Figure S3; Note S3). Acetone generally removes the PMMAsacriﬁcial transfer layer to harvest clean graphene. However, acetone-treatedhydrophobic graphene does not facilitate the process of perovskite crystallization.UV-ozone treatment is a conventional hydrophilia post-processing technology.However, when UV-ozone is exploited to treat the graphene, it destroys its lattice.Therefore, the hydrophilic strategy of graphene is updated to an anti-solvent oftoluene, which would help crystallize the perovskite due to the hydrophilic gra-phene. Additionally, Ag-rGO was synthesized via a microwave strategy as an ultra-high mobility and conductivity additive.22,23 After that, the Ag-rGO was added tothe precursor solution. This as-synthesized Ag-rGO hybrid can accelerate carriergeneration and fast extraction.24 Finally, the perovskite ﬁlms were in situ preparedby a hot-casting scheme to obtain millimeter-scale grain.25 Herein, the hot platewas maintained at 100C for spin coating, resulting in a highly oriented crystal, whichwould reduce trap defects and improve mobility in the perovskite.

"Structural characteristicsTo conﬁrm the contribution of the underlying graphene and Ag-rGO for perovskitegrain growth and assembly, the structural characteristics of the perovskite, underly-ing graphene, and Ag-rGO are analyzed. Herein, the cross-sectional image and sur-face morphology of the MAPbI3 perovskite ﬁlm show that the perovskite ﬁlm with anapproximately 640 nm thickness was compactly grown without a pinhole under theassistance of an underlying graphene template (Figures 2A and 2B). The D and Gbands of underlying graphene are located at 1,347 and 1,599 cm1, and a lowratio of IG/I2D peaks proves it is a single-layer graphene. Moreover, the averagesize of the induced grain is increased from 2.4 to 40 mm via perfect wettabilityand template inducement (Figure 2C). This improved grain size is over an order ofmagnitude compared to a conventional post-annealing strategy. This effective tem-plate strategy26 beneﬁts from the compatible and matching atomic conﬁgurationbetween the tetragonal (b-phase) perovskite and hexagonal graphene. Additionally,the typical morphological features of Ag-rGO were determined by transmissionelectron microscopy (TEM) analysis (Figure 2D). The high-resolution TEM image ofAg-rGO gives its lattice fringe, corresponding to (111) planes of the Ag nanopar-ticles with an interplanar distance of 0.23 nm.27 It is found that Ag nanoparticlesanchoring in rGO were typically spherical, with a (111) crystallographic orientationand a Gaussian distribution with a size between 10 and 15 nm dispersed uniformly(Figure S4; Note S4).",8.16,False,4,57.65472412109375,414.6237487792969,False,False,False,body

"To gain insight into the contribution of graphene and Ag-rGO for efﬁcient electron-hole dissociation, transfer, and extraction, the steady-state and time-resolved pho-toluminescence (TRPL) spectra are investigated. Figure 3E exhibits the steady-statePL spectra of the perovskite, graphene/perovskite, and graphene/perovskite/Ag-rGO hybrid samples at room temperature. Under the same experimental conditions,the peak was located at 769.5 nm and had a little red shift to 770.6 nm when Ag-rGOwas added. Moreover, there was a decrease in the PL intensity of up to nearly 80% forthe hybrid perovskite. This phenomenon results from reduced defects and the effec-tive transfer of photon-generated carriers. Therefore, the quantum yield is limited,and the transfer time of carriers is shortened, which could be supported by theTRPL decay curves (shown in Figure 3F). The PL lifetime changed from 45.0 to7.8 ns (Table S1) when the perovskite was spun onto the graphene. The lifetimewas further shortened when the Ag-rGO was added into the perovskite with a life-time of approximately 4.4 ns. This is the direct consequence of the charge-carrierextraction across the interface of graphene and perovskite. Therefore, the effectivetransfer of photon-generated carriers is a critical prerequisite of high-performancedetectors. Herein, the photon-generated hole in the graphene/perovskite/Ag-rGO hybrid architecture is transferred from the valence band of the perovskite tographene.

"After that, the energy band and density of states of the heterojunction constructedby the perovskite-loaded silver dimer, rGO adsorbed on the perovskite, and perov-skite assembled on the graphene were calculated. After adding Ag-rGO to theperovskite, the response performance of the photodetector has been signiﬁcantlyimproved. To explore the reasons for the improved photoelectric performance,the band structure, density of states, and differential charge density of rGO withsmall molecules and silver dimers anchored on the surface of perovskite are calcu-lated (Figures 4A and 4B). The silver load on the perovskite produces a plasma effectto promote the light absorption of the perovskite. The loading of the silver dimercauses the top of the valence band to move up. This is because the silver dimer’scharge transfer occurs on the perovskite’s surface, and then the coupling occurs.The charge in the silver dimer is transferred to the perovskite so that the concentra-tion of carriers in the perovskite can be increased, resulting in improved photoelec-tric performance. After adding rGO molecules, the energy band structure shows thatthe conduction band shifts downwards and the valence band tops shift upwards,which helps to reduce the stimulated energy for electronic transitions (Figures 4C",8.47,False,8,57.656700134277344,533.6795043945312,False,False,False,body
